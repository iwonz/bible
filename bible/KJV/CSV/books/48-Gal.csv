en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.11,Gal 3:11,10,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."

en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.14,Gal 3:14,13,That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.15,Gal 3:15,14,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto."
en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.16,Gal 3:16,15,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.17,Gal 3:17,16,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.18,Gal 3:18,17,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
en,KJV,Gal,Gal,47,Gal.3,Gal 3,2,Gal.3.19,Gal 3:19,18,"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
