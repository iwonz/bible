      <v id="1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</v>
      <v id="2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</v>
      <v id="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v id="4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</v>
      <v id="5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</v>
      <v id="6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</v>
      <v id="7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</v>
      <v id="8">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</v>
      <v id="9">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v id="10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</v>
      <v id="11">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</v>
      <v id="12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</v>
      <v id="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</v>
      <v id="14">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</v>
      <v id="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</v>
      <v id="16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</v>
      <v id="17">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</v>
      <v id="18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</v>
      <v id="19">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</v>
      <v id="20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</v>
      <v id="21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</v>
      <v id="22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</v>
      <v id="23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</v>
      <v id="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</v>
      <v id="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</v>
