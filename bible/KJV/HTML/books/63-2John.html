  <h1>2 John</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.1"><sup><a href="#2John.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.2"><sup><a href="#2John.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.3"><sup><a href="#2John.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.4"><sup><a href="#2John.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.5"><sup><a href="#2John.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.6"><sup><a href="#2John.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.7"><sup><a href="#2John.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.8"><sup><a href="#2John.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.9"><sup><a href="#2John.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.10"><sup><a href="#2John.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.11"><sup><a href="#2John.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.12"><sup><a href="#2John.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.13"><sup><a href="#2John.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
