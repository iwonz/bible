  <h1>Titus</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.1"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.2"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.3"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.4"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.5"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.6"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.7"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.8"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.9"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.10"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.11"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.12"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.13"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.14"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.15"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.1.16"><sup><a href="#Titus.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.1"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.2"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.3"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.4"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.5"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.6"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.7"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.8"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.9"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.10"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.11"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.12"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.13"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.14"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.2.15"><sup><a href="#Titus.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.1"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.2"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.3"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.4"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.5"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.6"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.7"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.8"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.9"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.10"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.11"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.12"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.13"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.14"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Titus.3.15"><sup><a href="#Titus.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
