  <h1>3 John</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.1"><sup><a href="#3John.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.2"><sup><a href="#3John.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.3"><sup><a href="#3John.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.4"><sup><a href="#3John.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.5"><sup><a href="#3John.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.6"><sup><a href="#3John.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.7"><sup><a href="#3John.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.8"><sup><a href="#3John.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.9"><sup><a href="#3John.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.10"><sup><a href="#3John.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.11"><sup><a href="#3John.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.12"><sup><a href="#3John.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.13"><sup><a href="#3John.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="3John.1.14"><sup><a href="#3John.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
