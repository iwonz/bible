  <h1>Philemon</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.1"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.2"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.3"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.4"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.5"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.6"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.7"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.8"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.9"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.10"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.11"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.12"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.13"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.14"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.15"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.16"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.17"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.18"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.19"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.20"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.21"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.22"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.23"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.24"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.25"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
