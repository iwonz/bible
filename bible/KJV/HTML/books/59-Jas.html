  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.1"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.2"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.3"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.4"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.5"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.6"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.7"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.8"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.9"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.10"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.11"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.12"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.13"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.14"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.15"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.16"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.17"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.18"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.19"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.20"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.21"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.22"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.23"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.24"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.25"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.26"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.1.27"><sup><a href="#Jas.1.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.1"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.2"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.3"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.4"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.5"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.6"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.7"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.8"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.9"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.10"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.11"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.12"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.13"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.14"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.15"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.16"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.17"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.18"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.19"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.20"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.21"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.22"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.23"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.24"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.25"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.2.26"><sup><a href="#Jas.2.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.1"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.2"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.3"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.4"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.5"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.6"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.7"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.8"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.9"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.10"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.11"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.12"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.13"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.14"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.15"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.16"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.17"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.3.18"><sup><a href="#Jas.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.1"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.2"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.3"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.4"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.5"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.6"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.7"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.8"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.9"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.10"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.11"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.12"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.13"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.14"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.15"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.16"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.4.17"><sup><a href="#Jas.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Jas.5.1"><sup><a href="#Jas.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Jas.5.5"><sup><a href="#Jas.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
