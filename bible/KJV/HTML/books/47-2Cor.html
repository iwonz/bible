  <h1>2 Corinthians</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.7"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.11"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.12"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.13"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.14"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.15"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.16"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.17"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.18"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.19"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.20"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.21"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.22"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.23"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.1.24"><sup><a href="#2Cor.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.7"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.11"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.12"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.13"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.14"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.15"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.16"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.2.17"><sup><a href="#2Cor.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.7"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.11"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.12"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.13"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.14"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.15"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.16"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.17"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.3.18"><sup><a href="#2Cor.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.7"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.11"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.12"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.13"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.14"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.15"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.16"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.17"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.4.18"><sup><a href="#2Cor.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.7"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.11"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.12"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.13"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.14"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.15"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.16"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.17"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.18"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.19"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.20"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.5.21"><sup><a href="#2Cor.5.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.2"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.3"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.4"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.5"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.6"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.8"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.9"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.6.10"><sup><a href="#2Cor.6.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="2Cor.12.1"><sup><a href="#2Cor.12.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
