  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.9"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.8.23"><sup><a href="#Ezra.8.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</p>
