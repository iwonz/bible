  <h1>Nehemiah</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.12"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.13"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.14"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.15"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.16"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.17"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.18"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.19"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.20"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.14"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.15"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.16"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.12"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.13"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.14"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.15"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.16"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.17"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.18"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.19"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.20"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.21"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.22"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.23"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?

  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.25"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.26"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.27"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.28"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.29"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.29" class="verse-number">29</a></sup> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.30"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.13.31"><sup><a href="#Neh.13.31" class="verse-number">31</a></sup> And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>
