    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
