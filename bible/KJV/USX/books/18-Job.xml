  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Job spake, and said,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>But Job answered and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

  <chapter number="9" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Job answered and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,

    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:

    <verse number="21" style="v"/>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:

    <verse number="27" style="v"/>He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Elihu also proceeded, and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
