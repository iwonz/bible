      <VERS vnumber="19">"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the singers, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, with the sounding of rams' horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the LORD and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the LORD, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and shelter the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"All this," David said, "I have in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">David also said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the LORD is finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing man skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then King David said to the whole assembly: "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God-gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble-all of these in large quantities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">three thousand talents of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So they all praised the LORD, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the LORD and the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and presented burnt offerings to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">All the officers and mighty men, as well as all of King David's sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He ruled over Israel forty years-seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As for the events of King David's reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.</VERS>
