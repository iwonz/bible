    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father "? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and put everything under his feet.? In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double--edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father. "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God permitting, we will do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case--things that accompany salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is founded on better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God found fault with the people and said: "The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll--I have come to do your will, O God.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For in just a very little while, "He who is coming will come and will not delay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This is what the ancients were commended for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">even though God had said to him, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Make level paths for your feet," so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">because they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The words "once more" indicate the removing of what can be shaken--that is, created things--so that what cannot be shaken may remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">for our "God is a consuming fire."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Keep on loving each other as brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by ceremonial foods, which are of no value to those who eat them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise--the fruit of lips that confess his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Brothers, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written you only a short letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Greet all your leaders and all God's people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Grace be with you all.</VERS>
