      <VERS vnumber="1">The elder,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</VERS>
