    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; he will pursue his foes into darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Whatever they plot against the LORD he will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">From you, O Nineveh, has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and counsels wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This is what the LORD says: "Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, O Judah, I will afflict you no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The LORD has given a command concerning you, Nineveh: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The shields of his soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of pine are brandished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He summons his picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away. Its slave girls moan like doves and beat upon their breasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nineveh is like a pool, and its water is draining away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Where now is the lions' den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"I am against you," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"I am against you," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All who see you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is in ruins-who will mourn for her?' Where can I find anyone to comfort you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her? The river was her defense, the waters her wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet she was taken captive and went into exile. Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Look at your troops- they are all women! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed their bars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses! Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down and, like grasshoppers, consume you. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more than the stars of the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day- but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O king of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Nothing can heal your wound; your injury is fatal. Everyone who hears the news about you claps his hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?</VERS>
