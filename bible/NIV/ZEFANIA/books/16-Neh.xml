    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I said: "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble-burned as they are?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, "What they are building-if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Also our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their Jewish brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Some were saying, "We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Still others were saying, "We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and said: "As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them-the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"We will give it back," they said. "And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!" At this the whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year-twelve years-neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the earlier governors-those preceding me-placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember me with favor, O my God, for all I have done for these people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it-though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in which was written: "It is reported among the nations-and Geshem says it is true-that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed, "Now strengthen my hands."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you-by night they are coming to kill you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them.

      <VERS vnumber="24">Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets, who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them.

      <VERS vnumber="29">"You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">of Ezra's, Meshullam; of Amariah's, Jehohanan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">of Malluch's, Jonathan; of Shecaniah's, Joseph;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">of Harim's, Adna; of Meremoth's, Helkai;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">of Iddo's, Zechariah; of Ginnethon's, Meshullam;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">of Abijah's, Zicri; of Miniamin's and of Moadiah's, Piltai;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">of Bilgah's, Shammua; of Shemaiah's, Jehonathan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">of Joiarib's, Mattenai; of Jedaiah's, Uzzi;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">of Sallu's, Kallai; of Amok's, Eber;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">of Hilkiah's, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah's, Nethanel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The singers also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem-from the villages of the Netophathites,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and his associates-Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani-with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of the wall, together with half the people-past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">as well as the priests-Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah's household goods out of the room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and singers responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I rebuked the officials and asked them, "Why is the house of God neglected?" Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and oil into the storerooms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because these men were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days I saw men in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Men from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this wicked thing you are doing-desecrating the Sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Didn't your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity upon us and upon this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, O my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said: "You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Remember them, O my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, O my God.</VERS>
