    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them-to the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates-all the Hittite country-to the Great Sea on the west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: 'The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After three days the officers went throughout the camp,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">giving orders to the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark; do not go near it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: 'When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the river.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD -the Lord of all the earth-set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the LORD said to Joshua,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt-all the men of military age-died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The commander of the LORD's army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he ordered the people, "Advance! March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD's covenant followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Joshua had commanded the people, "Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it-men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho-and she lives among the Israelites to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: "Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: "At the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD's anger burned against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy out the region." So the men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When they returned to Joshua, they said, "Not all the people will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people, for only a few men are there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: That which is devoted is among you, O Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"'In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan that the LORD takes shall come forward family by family; and the family that the LORD takes shall come forward man by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He who is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done a disgraceful thing in Israel!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give him the praise. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">with these orders: "Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai-but Joshua spent that night with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They had the soldiers take up their positions-all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Twelve thousand men and women fell that day-all the people of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses-an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses, which he had written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing those who carried it-the priests, who were Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law-the blessings and the curses-just as it is written in the Book of the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the aliens who lived among them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things-those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "But perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"We are your servants," they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, "Who are you and where do you come from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan-Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, 'Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; make a treaty with us."'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but all the leaders answered, "We have given them our oath by the LORD, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You are now under a curse: You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would choose. And that is what they are to this day.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the five kings of the Amorites-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon-joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely-almost to a man-but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they brought the five kings out of the cave-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army-until no survivors were left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.</VERS>
