    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary- those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"My sins have been bound into a yoke; by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within, my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I say, "My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let him bury his face in the dust- there may yet be hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">to deny a man his rights before the Most High,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">to deprive a man of justice- would not the Lord see such things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">"We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">"You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">"All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">O LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter's hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because of thirst the infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the world's people, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now they grope through the streets like men who are blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Go away! You are unclean!" men cry to them. "Away! Away! Don't touch us!" When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say, "They can stay here no longer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The LORD himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Men stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The LORD's anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked.</VERS>
