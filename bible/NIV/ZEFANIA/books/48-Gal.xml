    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they praised God because of me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been to the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"We who are Jews by birth and not 'Gentile sinners'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a lawbreaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have you suffered so much for nothing--if it really was for nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you heard?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Consider Abraham: "He believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: "All nations will be blessed through you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written: "Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The entire law is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for each one should carry his own load.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</VERS>
