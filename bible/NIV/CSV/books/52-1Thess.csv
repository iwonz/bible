en,NIV,1Thess,1Thess,51,1Thess.2,1Thess 2,1,1Thess.2.15,1Thess 2:15,14,who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men
en,NIV,1Thess,1Thess,51,1Thess.2,1Thess 2,1,1Thess.2.16,1Thess 2:16,15,in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.

en,NIV,1Thess,1Thess,51,1Thess.5,1Thess 5,4,1Thess.5.2,1Thess 5:2,1,for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
en,NIV,1Thess,1Thess,51,1Thess.5,1Thess 5,4,1Thess.5.3,1Thess 5:3,2,"While people are saying, ""Peace and safety,"" destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape."
