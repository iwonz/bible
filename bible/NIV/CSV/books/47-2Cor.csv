en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.5,2Cor 1:5,4,"For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.7,2Cor 1:7,6,"And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.8,2Cor 1:8,7,"We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.12,2Cor 1:12,11,"Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.17,2Cor 1:17,16,"When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, ""Yes, yes"" and ""No, no""?"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.18,2Cor 1:18,17,"But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not ""Yes"" and ""No."""
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.19,2Cor 1:19,18,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not ""Yes"" and ""No,"" but in him it has always been ""Yes."""
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.20,2Cor 1:20,19,"For no matter how many promises God has made, they are ""Yes"" in Christ. And so through him the ""Amen"" is spoken by us to the glory of God."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.1,2Cor 1,0,2Cor.1.21,2Cor 1:21,20,"Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,"

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.2,2Cor 2:2,1,"For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?"

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.4,2Cor 2:4,3,"For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.5,2Cor 2:5,4,"If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.9,2Cor 2:9,8,The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.10,2Cor 2:10,9,"If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.11,2Cor 2:11,10,in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.12,2Cor 2:12,11,"Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.13,2Cor 2:13,12,"I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.14,2Cor 2:14,13,"But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.15,2Cor 2:15,14,For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.16,2Cor 2:16,15,"To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.2,2Cor 2,1,2Cor.2.17,2Cor 2:17,16,"Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.1,2Cor 3:1,0,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.2,2Cor 3:2,1,"You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.3,2Cor 3:3,2,"You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.4,2Cor 3:4,3,Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.5,2Cor 3:5,4,"Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.6,2Cor 3:6,5,"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.7,2Cor 3:7,6,"Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.8,2Cor 3:8,7,will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.9,2Cor 3:9,8,"If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.10,2Cor 3:10,9,For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.11,2Cor 3:11,10,"And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.12,2Cor 3:12,11,"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.13,2Cor 3:13,12,"We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.14,2Cor 3:14,13,"But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.15,2Cor 3:15,14,"Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.16,2Cor 3:16,15,"But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.3,2Cor 3,2,2Cor.3.17,2Cor 3:17,16,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.1,2Cor 4:1,0,"Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.2,2Cor 4:2,1,"Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.3,2Cor 4:3,2,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.5,2Cor 4:5,4,"For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.6,2Cor 4:6,5,"For God, who said, ""Let light shine out of darkness,"" made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.7,2Cor 4:7,6,But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.8,2Cor 4:8,7,"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;"

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.10,2Cor 4:10,9,"We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.11,2Cor 4:11,10,"For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.12,2Cor 4:12,11,"So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.13,2Cor 4:13,12,"It is written: ""I believed; therefore I have spoken."" With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,"
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.14,2Cor 4:14,13,because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.15,2Cor 4:15,14,"All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.16,2Cor 4:16,15,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.17,2Cor 4:17,16,For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.4,2Cor 4,3,2Cor.4.18,2Cor 4:18,17,"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.5,2Cor 5,4,2Cor.5.1,2Cor 5:1,0,"Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands."

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.5,2Cor 5,4,2Cor.5.4,2Cor 5:4,3,"For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.5,2Cor 5,4,2Cor.5.5,2Cor 5:5,4,"Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come."
en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.5,2Cor 5,4,2Cor.5.6,2Cor 5:6,5,Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.

en,NIV,2Cor,2Cor,46,2Cor.5,2Cor 5,4,2Cor.5.14,2Cor 5:14,13,"For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died."
