en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.21,2Pet 1:21,20,"For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.1,2Pet 2:1,0,"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.

en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.5,2Pet 2:5,4,"if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;"
en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.6,2Pet 2:6,5,"if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;"
en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.7,2Pet 2:7,6,"and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men"

en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.12,2Pet 2:12,11,"But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish."
en,NIV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.13,2Pet 2:13,12,"They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you."
