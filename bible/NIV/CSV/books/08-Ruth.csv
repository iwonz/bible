en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.1,Ruth 1,0,Ruth.1.13,Ruth 1:13,12,"would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!"""
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.1,Ruth 1,0,Ruth.1.14,Ruth 1:14,13,"At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her."

en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.14,Ruth 2:14,13,"At mealtime Boaz said to her, ""Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar."" When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over."
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.15,Ruth 2:15,14,"As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, ""Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her."

en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.17,Ruth 2:17,16,"So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah."
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.18,Ruth 2:18,17,"She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough."

Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. ""The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,"" she said."
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.20,Ruth 2:20,19,"""The LORD bless him!"" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. ""He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead."" She added, ""That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers."""
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.21,Ruth 2:21,20,"Then Ruth the Moabitess said, ""He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"""

en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.2,Ruth 2,1,Ruth.2.23,Ruth 2:23,22,So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.3,Ruth 3,2,Ruth.3.1,Ruth 3:1,0,"One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, ""My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for?"

en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.3,Ruth 3,2,Ruth.3.6,Ruth 3:6,5,So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.3,Ruth 3,2,Ruth.3.7,Ruth 3:7,6,"When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down."

en,NIV,Ruth,Ruth,7,Ruth.3,Ruth 3,2,Ruth.3.14,Ruth 3:14,13,"So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, ""Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."""
