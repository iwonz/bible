en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.1,Heb 1,0,Heb.1.3,Heb 1:3,2,"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.1,Heb 1,0,Heb.1.4,Heb 1:4,3,So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.1,Heb 1,0,Heb.1.5,Heb 1:5,4,"For to which of the angels did God ever say, ""You are my Son; today I have become your Father ""? Or again, ""I will be his Father, and he will be my Son""?"
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.1,Heb 1,0,Heb.1.6,Heb 1:6,5,"And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, ""Let all God's angels worship him."""

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.1,Heb 1,0,Heb.1.14,Heb 1:14,13,Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.1,Heb 2:1,0,"We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.2,Heb 2:2,1,"For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,"

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.4,Heb 2:4,3,"God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.5,Heb 2:5,4,"It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.6,Heb 2:6,5,"But there is a place where someone has testified: ""What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?"

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.11,Heb 2:11,10,Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.12,Heb 2:12,11,"He says, ""I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises."""

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.2,Heb 2,1,Heb.2.18,Heb 2:18,17,"Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.3,Heb 3,2,Heb.3.1,Heb 3:1,0,"Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.3,Heb 3,2,Heb.3.18,Heb 3:18,17,And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.3,Heb 3,2,Heb.3.19,Heb 3:19,18,"So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.4,Heb 4,3,Heb.4.7,Heb 4:7,6,"Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: ""Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."""
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.4,Heb 4,3,Heb.4.8,Heb 4:8,7,"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.4,Heb 4,3,Heb.4.12,Heb 4:12,11,"For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double--edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.4,Heb 4,3,Heb.4.13,Heb 4:13,12,Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.4,Heb 4,3,Heb.4.15,Heb 4:15,14,"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.10,Heb 9:10,9,They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order.

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.15,Heb 9:15,14,"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.17,Heb 9:17,16,because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.24,Heb 9:24,23,"For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.25,Heb 9:25,24,"Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.26,Heb 9:26,25,Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.9,Heb 9,8,Heb.9.28,Heb 9:28,27,"so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him."
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.10,Heb 10,9,Heb.10.1,Heb 10:1,0,"The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship."

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.10,Heb 10,9,Heb.10.4,Heb 10:4,3,because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.10,Heb 10,9,Heb.10.14,Heb 10:14,13,because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
en,NIV,Heb,Heb,57,Heb.10,Heb 10,9,Heb.10.15,Heb 10:15,14,The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
