  <lyrics>
    <verse label="Job 1:1">In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:2">He had seven sons and three daughters,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:3">and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:4">His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:5">When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:6">One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:7">The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:8">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:9">"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:10">"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:11">But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:12">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:13">One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:14">a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:15">and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:16">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:17">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:18">While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:19">when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:20">At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:21">and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 1:22">In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:1">On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:2">And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:3">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:4">"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:5">But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:6">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:7">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:8">Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:9">His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:10">He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:11">When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:12">When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 2:13">Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:2">He said:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:3">"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:4">That day-may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:5">May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:6">That night-may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:7">May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:8">May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:9">May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:10">for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:11">"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:12">Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:15">with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:16">Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:17">There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:18">Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:20">"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:21">to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:22">who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:24">For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:25">What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 3:26">I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:2">"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:3">Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:4">Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:5">But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:6">Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:7">"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:8">As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:9">At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:10">The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:11">The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:12">"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:13">Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:14">fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:15">A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:16">It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:17">'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:18">If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:19">how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:20">Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 4:21">Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:1">"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:2">Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:3">I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:4">His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:5">The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:6">For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:7">Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:8">"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:9">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:10">He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:11">The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:12">He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:13">He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:14">Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:15">He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:17">"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:18">For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:19">From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:20">In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:21">You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:22">You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:23">For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:24">You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:25">You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:26">You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 5:27">"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:2">"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:3">It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas- no wonder my words have been impetuous.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:4">The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:5">Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:6">Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:7">I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:8">"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:9">that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:10">Then I would still have this consolation- my joy in unrelenting pain- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:11">"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:12">Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:13">Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:14">"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:15">But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:16">when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:17">but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:18">Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:19">The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:20">They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:21">Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:22">Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:23">deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:24">"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:25">How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:26">Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:27">You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:28">"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:29">Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 6:30">Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:1">"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:2">Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:3">so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:4">When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:5">My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:6">"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:7">Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:8">The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:9">As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:10">He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:11">"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:12">Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:13">When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:14">even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:15">so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:16">I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:17">"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:18">that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:19">Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:20">If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 7:21">Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:2">"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:3">Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:4">When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:5">But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:6">if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:7">Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:8">"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:9">for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:10">Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:11">Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:12">While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:13">Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:14">What he trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:15">He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:16">He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:17">it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:18">But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:19">Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:20">"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:21">He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 8:22">Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:2">"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:3">Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:4">His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:5">He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:6">He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:7">He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:10">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:11">When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:12">If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:13">God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:14">"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:15">Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:16">Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:17">He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:18">He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:19">If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:20">Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:21">"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:22">It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:23">When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:24">When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:25">"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:26">They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:27">If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:28">I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:29">Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:30">Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:31">you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:32">"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:33">If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:34">someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 9:35">Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:1">"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:2">I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:3">Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:4">Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:5">Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:6">that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:7">though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:8">"Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:9">Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:10">Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:11">clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:12">You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:13">"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:14">If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:15">If I am guilty-woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:16">If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:17">You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:18">"Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:19">If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:20">Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:21">before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 10:22">to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:2">"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:3">Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:4">You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:5">Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:6">and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:7">"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:8">They are higher than the heavens-what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave -what can you know?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:9">Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:10">"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:11">Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:12">But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:13">"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:14">if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:15">then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:16">You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:17">Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:18">You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:19">You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 11:20">But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:2">"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:3">But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:4">"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:5">Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:6">The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure- those who carry their god in their hands.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:7">"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:8">or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:9">Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:10">In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:11">Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:12">Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:13">"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:14">What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:15">If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:16">To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:17">He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:18">He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:19">He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:20">He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:21">He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:22">He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:23">He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:24">He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 12:25">They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:1">"My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:2">What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:3">But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:4">You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:5">If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:6">Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:7">Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:8">Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:9">Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:10">He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:11">Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:12">Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:13">"Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:14">Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:15">Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:16">Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:17">Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:18">Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:19">Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:20">"Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:21">Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:22">Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:23">How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:24">Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:25">Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:26">For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:27">You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 13:28">"So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:1">"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:2">He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:3">Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:4">Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:5">Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:6">So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:7">"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:8">Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:9">yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:10">But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:11">As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:12">so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:13">"If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:14">If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:15">You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:16">Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:17">My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:18">"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:19">as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:20">You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:21">If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 14:22">He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:2">"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:3">Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:4">But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:5">Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:6">Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:7">"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:8">Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:9">What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:10">The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:11">Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:12">Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:13">so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:14">"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:15">If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:16">how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:17">"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:18">what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:19">(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:20">All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:21">Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:22">He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:23">He wanders about-food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:24">Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:25">because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:26">defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:27">"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:28">he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:29">He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:30">He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:31">Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:32">Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:33">He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:34">For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 15:35">They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:2">"I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:3">Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:4">I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:5">But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:6">"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:7">Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:8">You have bound me-and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:9">God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:10">Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:11">God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:12">All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:13">his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:14">Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:15">"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:16">My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:17">yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:18">"O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:19">Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:20">My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:21">on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 16:22">"Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:1">My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:2">Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:3">"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:4">You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:5">If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:6">"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:7">My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:8">Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:9">Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:10">"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:11">My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:12">These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 17:13">If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</verse>

    <verse label="Job 17:16">Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:2">"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:3">Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:4">You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:5">"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 18:8">His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:9">A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:10">A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 18:13">It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:14">He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:15">Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:16">His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:17">The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:18">He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:19">He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:20">Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 18:21">Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:2">"How long will you torment me and crush me with words?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:3">Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 19:7">"Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:8">He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:9">He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:10">He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:11">His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:12">His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:13">"He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:14">My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:15">My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:16">I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:17">My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:18">Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:19">All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:20">I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:21">"Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:22">Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:23">"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:24">that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:25">I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:26">And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:27">I myself will see him with my own eyes-I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:28">"If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, '</verse>
    <verse label="Job 19:29">you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. "</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:2">"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:3">I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:4">"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:5">that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:6">Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:7">he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:8">Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:9">The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:10">His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:11">The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:12">"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:13">though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:14">yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:15">He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:16">He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:17">He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:18">What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:19">For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:20">"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:21">Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:22">In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:23">When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:24">Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:25">He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:26">total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:27">The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:28">A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 20:29">Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:2">"Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:3">Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:4">"Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:5">Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:6">When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:7">Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:8">They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:9">Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:10">Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:11">They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:12">They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:13">They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:14">Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:15">Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:16">But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:17">"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:18">How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:19">It is said, 'God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:20">Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:21">For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:22">"Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:23">One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:24">his body well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:25">Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:26">Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:27">"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:28">You say, 'Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:29">Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:30">that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from the day of wrath?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:31">Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:32">He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:33">The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes before him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 21:34">"So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:2">"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:3">What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:4">"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:5">Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:6">You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:7">You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:8">though you were a powerful man, owning land- an honored man, living on it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:9">And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:10">That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:11">why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:12">"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:13">Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:14">Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:15">Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:16">They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:17">They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:18">Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:19">"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:20">'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:21">"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:22">Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:23">If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:24">and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:25">then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:26">Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:27">You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:28">What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:29">When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 22:30">He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:2">"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:3">If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:4">I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:5">I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:6">Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:7">There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:8">"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:9">When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:10">But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:11">My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:12">I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:13">"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:14">He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:15">That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:16">God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 23:17">Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:1">"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:2">Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:3">They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:4">They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:5">Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:6">They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:7">Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:8">They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:9">The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:10">Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:11">They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:12">The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:13">"There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:14">When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:15">The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:16">In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:17">For all of them, deep darkness is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:18">"Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:19">As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:20">The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:21">They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:22">But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:23">He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:24">For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 24:25">"If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:2">"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:3">Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:4">How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:5">If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 25:6">how much less man, who is but a maggot- a son of man, who is only a worm!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:2">"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:3">What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:4">Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:5">"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:6">Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:7">He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:8">He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:9">He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:10">He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:11">The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:12">By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:13">By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 26:14">And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:1">And Job continued his discourse:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:2">"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:3">as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:4">my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:5">I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:6">I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:7">"May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:8">For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:9">Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:10">Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:11">"I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:12">You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:13">"Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:14">However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:15">The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:16">Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:17">what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:18">The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:19">He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:21">The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:22">It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 27:23">It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:1">"There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:2">Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:3">Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:4">Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:5">The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:6">sapphires come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:7">No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:8">Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:9">Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:10">He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:11">He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:12">"But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:13">Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:14">The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:15">It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:16">It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:17">Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:18">Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:19">The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:20">"Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:21">It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:22">Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:23">God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:24">for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:25">When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:26">when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:27">then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 28:28">And he said to man, 'The fear of the Lord-that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:1">Job continued his discourse:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:2">"How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:3">when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:4">Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:5">when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:6">when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:7">"When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:8">the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:9">the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:10">the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:11">Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:12">because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:13">The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:14">I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:15">I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:16">I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:17">I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:18">"I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:19">My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:20">My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:21">"Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:22">After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:23">They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:24">When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 29:25">I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:1">"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:2">Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:3">Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:4">In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:5">They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:6">They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:7">They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:8">A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:9">"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:10">They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:11">Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:12">On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:13">They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me- without anyone's helping them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:14">They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:15">Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:16">"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:17">Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:18">In his great power God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:19">He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:20">"I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:21">You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:22">You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:23">I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:24">"Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:25">Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:26">Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:27">The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:28">I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:29">I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:30">My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 30:31">My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:1">"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:2">For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:3">Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:4">Does he not see my ways and count my every step?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:5">"If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:6">let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:7">if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:8">then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:9">"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:10">then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:11">For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:12">It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:13">"If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:14">what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:15">Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:16">"If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:17">if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:18">but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:19">if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:20">and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:21">if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:22">then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:23">For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:24">"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:25">if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:26">if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:27">so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:28">then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:29">"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:30">I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:31">if the men of my household have never said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:32">but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:33">if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:34">because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:35">("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense-let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:36">Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:37">I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:38">"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:39">if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 31:40">then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:2">But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:3">He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:4">Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:5">But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:6">So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:7">I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:8">But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:9">It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:10">"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:11">I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:12">I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:13">Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:14">But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:15">"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:17">I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:18">For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:19">inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:21">I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 32:22">for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:1">"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:2">I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:3">My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:4">The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:5">Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:6">I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:7">No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:8">"But you have said in my hearing- I heard the very words-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:9">'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:10">Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:11">He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:12">"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:13">Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:14">For God does speak-now one way, now another- though man may not perceive it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:16">he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:17">to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:18">to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:19">Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:20">so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:21">His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:22">His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:23">"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:24">to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:25">then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:26">He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:27">Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:29">"God does all these things to a man- twice, even three times-</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:30">to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:31">"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:32">If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 33:33">But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:1">Then Elihu said:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:2">"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:3">For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:4">Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:5">"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:6">Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:7">What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:8">He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:9">For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:10">"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:11">He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:12">It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:13">Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:14">If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:15">all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:16">"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:17">Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:18">Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:19">who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:20">They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:21">"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:22">There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:23">God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:24">Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:25">Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:26">He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:27">because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:28">They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:29">But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:30">to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:31">"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:32">Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:33">Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:34">"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:35">'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:36">Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 34:37">To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:1">Then Elihu said:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:2">"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God. '</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:3">Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:4">"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:5">Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:6">If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:7">If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:8">Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:9">"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:10">But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:11">who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:12">He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:13">Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:14">How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:15">and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 35:16">So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:1">Elihu continued:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:2">"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:3">I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:4">Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:5">"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:6">He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:7">He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:8">But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:9">he tells them what they have done- that they have sinned arrogantly.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:10">He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:11">If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:12">But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:13">"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 36:15">But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:16">"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:18">Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:19">Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:20">Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 36:24">Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:25">All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:26">How great is God-beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:27">"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:28">the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:29">Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:30">See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:31">This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:32">He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 36:33">His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:1">"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:2">Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:3">He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 37:18">can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:19">"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:20">Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:21">Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 37:22">Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.</verse>

    <verse label="Job 39:7">He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 39:8">He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 39:9">"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?</verse>

    <verse label="Job 40:1">The LORD said to Job:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:2">"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:3">Then Job answered the LORD:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:4">"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:5">I spoke once, but I have no answer- twice, but I will say no more."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:6">Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:7">"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:8">"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:9">Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:10">Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:11">Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:12">look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:13">Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:14">Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:15">"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:16">What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:17">His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:19">He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:20">The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:21">Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:22">The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:23">When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 40:24">Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:1">"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:3">Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:4">Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:5">Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:6">Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:9">Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:10">No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:11">Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:12">"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:14">Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:15">His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:16">each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:17">They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:18">His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:20">Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:22">Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:24">His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:25">When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:27">Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:28">Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:29">A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:31">He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:32">Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:33">Nothing on earth is his equal- a creature without fear.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 41:34">He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:1">Then Job replied to the LORD:</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:2">"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:3">You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:4">"You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:5">My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:6">Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:7">After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:8">So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:9">So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:10">After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:11">All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:12">The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:13">And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:14">The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:15">Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:16">After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</verse>
    <verse label="Job 42:17">And so he died, old and full of years.</verse>
