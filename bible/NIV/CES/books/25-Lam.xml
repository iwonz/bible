          <seg type="verse" n="1">How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary- those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">"From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">"My sins have been bound into a yoke; by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">"The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">"This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">"The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">"I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">"See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">"People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">"Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint."</seg>

        <div type="chapter" n="2">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within, my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">"Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">"Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">"As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed."</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="1">I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">So I say, "My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="27">It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="28">Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="29">Let him bury his face in the dust- there may yet be hope.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="30">Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="31">For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="32">Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="33">For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="34">To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="35">to deny a man his rights before the Most High,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="36">to deprive a man of justice- would not the Lord see such things?</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="41">Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="51">What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="52">Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="53">They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="54">the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="55">I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="56">You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="57">You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="58">O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="59">You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="2">How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter's hands!</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">Because of thirst the infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="20">The LORD's anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.</seg>
