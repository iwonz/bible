        <div type="chapter" n="1">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="2">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God--</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="4">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">Do your best to come to me quickly,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</seg>
