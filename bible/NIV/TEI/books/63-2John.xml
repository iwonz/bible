          <ab n="1">The elder,</ab>
          <ab n="2">To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</ab>
          <ab n="3">Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</ab>
          <ab n="4">It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</ab>
          <ab n="5">And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</ab>
          <ab n="6">And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</ab>
          <ab n="7">Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</ab>
          <ab n="8">Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</ab>
          <ab n="9">Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</ab>
          <ab n="10">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</ab>
          <ab n="11">Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</ab>
          <ab n="12">I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</ab>
          <ab n="13">The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</ab>
