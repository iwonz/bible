    <verse number="1" style="v"/>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>and worked them ruthlessly.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."

  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight-why the bush does not burn up."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey-the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>God said to Moses, "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites-a land flowing with milk and honey.'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."

  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?A staff," he replied.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has appeared to you."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, like snow.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met {Moses} and was about to kill him.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched {Moses'} feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.

  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, "Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are-lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and they said, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."
  </para>
  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zicri.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"
  </para>
  <chapter number="7" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' and it will become a snake."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'-and they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and stone jars."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials.'"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,' and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came upon men and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. And the gnats were on men and animals.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground where they are.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"'But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials, and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>But Moses said, "That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>We must take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and the LORD did what Moses asked: The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.

  <chapter number="9" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field-on your horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD set a time and said, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on men and animals.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt-on men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields-both men and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he said to them. "The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.

  <chapter number="10" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians-something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you-if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>No! Have only the men go; and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail-everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over Egypt-darkness that can be felt."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Just as you say," Moses replied, "I will never appear before you again."
  </para>
  <chapter number="11" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>(The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.)
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt-worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you-so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.
  </para>
  <chapter number="12" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire-head, legs and inner parts.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn-both men and animals-and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD -a lasting ordinance.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat-that is all you may do.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien or native-born.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover: "No foreigner is to eat of it.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>"It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>The same law applies to the native-born and to the alien living among you."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.

  <chapter number="13" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or animal."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Moses said to the people, "Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites-the land he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey-you are to observe this ceremony in this month:
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, "If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He had said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Egyptians-all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops-pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen-the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And when the Israelites saw the great power the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: "I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Your right hand, O LORD, was majestic in power. Your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood firm like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Who among the gods is like you, O LORD? Who is like you- majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>You stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people of Canaan will melt away;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>terror and dread will fall upon them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone- until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you bought pass by.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance- the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands established.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The LORD will reign for ever and ever."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her, with tambourines and dancing.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. )
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made a decree and a law for them, and there he tested them.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He said, "If you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
  </para>
  <chapter number="16" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.'"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much-two omers for each person-and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So the people rested on the seventh day.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>(An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD answered Moses, "Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up-one on one side, one on the other-so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He said, "For hands were lifted up to the throne of the LORD. The LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have become an alien in a foreign land";
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But select capable men from all the people-men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain-and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt-on the very day-they came to the Desert of Sinai.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal, he shall not be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But now, please forgive their sin-but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.

  <chapter number="33" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to his tent.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."

  <chapter number="34" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"O Lord, if I have found favor in your eyes," he said, "then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the LORD said: "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Do not make cast idols.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. "No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. "Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant-the Ten Commandments.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>But whenever he entered the LORD's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Moses said to the whole Israelite community, "This is what the LORD has commanded:
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows; acacia wood;
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary-both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows brought them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun-blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts-
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers-all of them master craftsmen and designers.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has commanded."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so the people were restrained from bringing more,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>All the skilled men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>All the curtains were the same size-twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle-eleven altogether.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>All eleven curtains were the same size-thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and made forty silver bases to go under them-two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>and forty silver bases-two under each frame.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases-two under each frame.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen-the work of an embroiderer;
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood-two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He made the atonement cover of pure gold-two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They made the table of acacia wood-two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They also made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And they made from pure gold the articles for the table-its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>They made the lampstand of pure gold and hammered it out, base and shaft; its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms were of one piece with it.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand-three on one side and three on the other.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair-six branches in all.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent of pure gold.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high -its horns of one piece with it.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They made two gold rings below the molding-two on opposite sides-to hold the poles used to carry it.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense-the work of a perfumer.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>They built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>They made all its utensils of bronze-its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely twisted linen,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The west end was fifty cubits wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Curtains fifteen cubits long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen-the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which were recorded at Moses' command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD commanded Moses;
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan-a craftsman and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.)
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel-
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>one beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain-100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>They made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen-the work of a skilled craftsman.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Its skillfully woven waistband was like it-of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They fashioned the breastpiece-the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>It was square-a span long and a span wide-and folded double.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and an emerald;
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst;
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree settings.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod-as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth-the work of a weaver-
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen-the work of a weaver-
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and the turban of fine linen, the linen headbands and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The sash was of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn-the work of an embroiderer-as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>They made the plate, the sacred diadem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>So all the work on the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of hides of sea cows and the shielding curtain;
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>the ark of the Testimony with its poles and the atonement cover;
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the oil for the light;
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the first month.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out-until the day it lifted.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels.
