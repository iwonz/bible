    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will--
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment--to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession--to the praise of his glory.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>not by works, so that no one can boast.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)--
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For this reason I kneel before the Father,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called--
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>(What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and do not give the devil a foothold.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Therefore do not be partners with them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and find out what pleases the Lord.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>for we are members of his body.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Honor your father and mother"--which is the first commandment with a promise--
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
