    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>One man from each tribe, each the head of his family, is to help you.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai:
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.

    <verse number="36" style="v"/>From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.

    <verse number="39" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>The total number was 603,550.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>The LORD had said to Moses:
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony-over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death.
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony."
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD talked with Moses on Mount Sinai.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Nadab and Abihu, however, fell dead before the LORD when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons; so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD also said to Moses,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether man or animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>At the Tent of Meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes-and everything related to their use.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of Meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>The total number of Levites counted at the LORD's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the LORD."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>The LORD also said to Moses,
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the LORD.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"This is the work of the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting: the care of the most holy things.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then they are to cover this with hides of sea cows, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Over these they are to spread a scarlet cloth, cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the oil used to supply it.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of hides of sea cows and put it on a carrying frame.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with hides of sea cows and put them on a carrying frame.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not cut off from the Levites.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"This is the service of the Gershonite clans as they work and carry burdens:

    <verse number="26" style="v"/>the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its service. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Count the Merarites by their clans and families.

    <verse number="33" style="v"/>This is the service of the Merarite clans as they work at the Tent of Meeting under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting,
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>counted by clans, were 2,750.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served in the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD's command through Moses.

    <verse number="45" style="v"/>This was the total of those in the Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD's command through Moses.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their clans and families.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work of serving and carrying the Tent of Meeting
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>numbered 8,580.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>At the LORD's command through Moses, each was assigned his work and told what to carry. Thus they were counted, as the LORD commanded Moses.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has an infectious skin disease or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Israelites did this; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Say to the Israelites: 'When a man or woman wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the LORD, that person is guilty

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Each man's sacred gifts are his own, but what he gives to the priest will belong to the priest.'"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'If a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>by sleeping with another man, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act),
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure-or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure-
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder offering to draw attention to guilt.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"'The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>After the priest has had the woman stand before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, "If no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have defiled yourself by sleeping with a man other than your husband"-
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>here the priest is to put the woman under this curse of the oath-"may the LORD cause your people to curse and denounce you when he causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away.  'Then the woman is to say, "Amen. So be it."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"'The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He shall have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water will enter her and cause bitter suffering.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it to the altar.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>If she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, then when she is made to drink the water that brings a curse, it will go into her and cause bitter suffering; her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste away, and she will become accursed among her people.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>If, however, the woman has not defiled herself and is free from impurity, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"'This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and defiles herself while married to her husband,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the LORD and is to apply this entire law to her.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.'"

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the LORD's command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>At the LORD's command they encamped, and at the LORD's command they set out. They obeyed the LORD's order, in accordance with his command through Moses.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If only one is sounded, the leaders-the heads of the clans of Israel-are to assemble before you.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the same signal.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Also at your times of rejoicing-your appointed feasts and New Moon festivals-you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They set out, this first time, at the LORD's command through Moses.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Whenever it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the LORD had burned among them. Quail From the LORD
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat!
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Moses heard the people of every family wailing, each at the entrance to his tent. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!'
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now-if I have found favor in your eyes-and do not let me face my own ruin."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>but for a whole month-until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it-because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the Tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It brought them down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground, as far as a day's walk in any direction.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam-leprous, like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So at the LORD's command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow them up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.'
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times-
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. "
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say:
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>In this desert your bodies will fall-every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But you-your bodies will fall in this desert.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>For forty years-one year for each of the forty days you explored the land-you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it-
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. "We have sinned," they said. "We will go up to the place the LORD promised."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD's command? This will not succeed!
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>for the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD's covenant moved from the camp.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The community is to have the same rules for you and for the alien living among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the alien shall be the same before the LORD:
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the alien living among you.'"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter the land to which I am taking you
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the LORD.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Present a cake from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the LORD from the first of your ground meal.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"'Now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the LORD gave Moses-
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>any of the LORD's commands to you through him, from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come-
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have brought to the LORD for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin offering.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The whole Israelite community and the aliens living among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"'But if just one person sins unintentionally, he must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The priest is to make atonement before the LORD for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether he is a native-born Israelite or an alien.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"'But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the LORD, and that person must be cut off from his people.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Because he has despised the LORD's word and broken his commands, that person must surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him.'"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.'"

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites-Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth-became insolent
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites!
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow-you and they and Aaron.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it-250 censers in all-and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy-
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>and the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The first offspring of every womb, both man and animal, that is offered to the LORD is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>While he watches, the heifer is to be burned-its hide, flesh, blood and offal.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.

    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Whoever touches the dead body of anyone and fails to purify himself defiles the LORD's tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean; his uncleanness remains on him.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and that evening he will be clean.

    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Israel made this vow to the LORD: "If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us." So Moses prayed for the people.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: "...Waheb in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I will give them water."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing about it,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank- the nobles with scepters and staffs." Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway until we have passed through your territory."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>That is why the poets say: "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's city be restored.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said: "A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me." So the Moabite princes stayed with him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, "Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>They came to Balaam and said: "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>That night God came to Balaam and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?No," he said.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"Well, I have come to you now," Balaam replied. "But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then Balaam uttered his oracle: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then he uttered his oracle: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD -and I must say only what the LORD says'?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: "Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then he uttered his oracle: "Ah, who can live when God does this?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Israel joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor. And the LORD's anger burned against them.

    <verse number="54" style="v"/>To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one; each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those listed.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. They approached
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly, and said,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Our father died in the desert. He was not among Korah's followers, who banded together against the LORD, but he died for his own sin and left no sons.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father's relatives."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So Moses brought their case before the LORD
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and the LORD said to him,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and turn their father's inheritance over to them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Say to the Israelites, 'If a man dies and leaves no son, turn his inheritance over to his daughter.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to be a legal requirement for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up this mountain in the Abarim range and see the land I have given the Israelites.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes." (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all mankind, appoint a man over this community
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the LORD's people will not be like sheep without a shepherd."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the LORD. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba-the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Moses was angry with the officers of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-who returned from the battle.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD's people.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses:
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep or goats.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>72,000 cattle,

    <verse number="40" style="v"/>16,000 people, of which the tribute for the LORD was 32.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part, as the LORD commanded Moses.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men-
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>the community's half-was 337,500 sheep,
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>36,000 cattle,
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>30,500 donkeys
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>and 16,000 people.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>From the Israelites' half, Moses selected one out of every fifty persons and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Then the officers who were over the units of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-went to Moses
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>and said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired-armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces-to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold-all the crafted articles.

    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon-
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel-are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, "Shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Why do you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the LORD has given them?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The LORD's anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>'Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The LORD's anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the desert, and you will be the cause of their destruction."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then they came up to him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But we are ready to arm ourselves and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his inheritance.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Moses said to them, "If you will do this-if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and if all of you will go armed over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him-
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The Gadites and Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has said.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan-the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.
