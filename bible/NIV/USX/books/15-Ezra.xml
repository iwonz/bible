    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: "'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Anyone of his people among you-may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.'"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites-everyone whose heart God had moved-prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>This was the inventory: gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1,000 silver pans 29
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls 410 other articles 1,000
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

    <verse number="60" style="v"/>The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda 652
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>And from among the priests: The descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there was a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>The whole company numbered 42,360,

    <verse number="68" style="v"/>When they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings toward the rebuilding of the house of God on its site.
    <verse number="69" style="v"/>According to their ability they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver and 100 priestly garments.
    <verse number="70" style="v"/>The priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants settled in their own towns, along with some of the other people, and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening sacrifices.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, though the foundation of the LORD's temple had not yet been laid.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work, appointing Levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Jeshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah ) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers-all Levites-joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the LORD, as prescribed by David king of Israel.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: "He is good; his love to Israel endures forever." And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, "Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, "You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates-the judges and officials over the men from Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>(This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and the royal revenues will suffer.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They also asked, "What are the names of the men constructing this building?"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The report they sent him read as follows: To King Darius: Cordial greetings.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>We questioned the elders and asked them, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>This is the answer they gave us: "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. "Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and he told him, 'Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: Memorandum:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from there.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: The expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Whatever is needed-young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem-must be given them daily without fail,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then the people of Israel-the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles-celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria, so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest-
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who wish to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>You and your brother Jews may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Now I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you-
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and of his sons?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates-all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Praise be to the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put it into the king's heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem in this way
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king's powerful officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his kinsmen, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 men.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They also brought 220 of the temple servants-a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and prayed: "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites-men, women and children-gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)
