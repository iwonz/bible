    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Let us break their chains," they say, "and throw off their fetters."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him." Selah
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But you are a shield around me, O LORD; you bestow glory on me and lift up my head.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>To the LORD I cry aloud, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods? Selah
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD will hear when I call to him.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. Selah
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies- make straight your way before me.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I am worn out from groaning; all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping.

    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet:
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>all flocks and herds, and the beasts of the field,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The LORD is known by his justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.

    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Arise, O LORD, let not man triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He boasts of the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>In his pride the wicked does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>His ways are always prosperous; he is haughty and your laws are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He says to himself, "Nothing will shake me; I'll always be happy and never have trouble."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent, watching in secret for his victims.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He says to himself, "God has forgotten; he covers his face and never sees."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, "He won't call me to account"?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.

    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him- the dark rain clouds of the sky.

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He shot his arrows and scattered the enemies, great bolts of lightning and routed them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

    <verse number="29" style="v"/>With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.

    <verse number="32" style="v"/>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.

    <verse number="37" style="v"/>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>They did not remember his power- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility- a band of destroying angels.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.
    <verse number="65" style="v"/>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.
    <verse number="66" style="v"/>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.
    <verse number="67" style="v"/>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
    <verse number="68" style="v"/>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
    <verse number="69" style="v"/>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
    <verse number="70" style="v"/>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;

    <verse number="34" style="v"/>They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.
