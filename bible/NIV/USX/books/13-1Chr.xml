    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and many others fell slain, because the battle was God's. And they occupied the land until the exile.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous; they settled in the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).

    <verse number="25" style="v"/>But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria), who took the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara and the river of Gozan, where they are to this day.

    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon. His wife's name was Maacah,

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>said to David, "You will not get in here." Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>David had said, "Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men-they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised-
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The mighty men were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in peace, to help me, I am ready to have you unite with me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: "We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you." So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Some of the men of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, "It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.")
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, as the LORD had said:

    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>men of Benjamin, Saul's kinsmen-3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul's house until then;
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>men of Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans-20,800;
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>men of half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king-18,000;
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do-200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;

    <verse number="38" style="v"/>All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So David assembled all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>David and all the Israelites with him went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim-the ark that is called by the Name.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They moved the ark of God from Abinadab's house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>David was afraid of God that day and asked, "How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he had.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>so David inquired of God: "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD answered him, "Go, I will hand them over to you."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand." So that place was called Baal Perazim.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Once more the Philistines raided the valley;

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way."

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>O descendants of Israel his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He allowed no man to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Sing to the LORD, all the earth; proclaim his salvation day after day.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy in his dwelling place.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Ascribe to the LORD, O families of nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name. Bring an offering and come before him; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Let the sea resound, and all that is in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then the trees of the forest will sing, they will sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Cry out, "Save us, O God our Savior; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, that we may glory in your praise."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said "Amen" and "Praise the LORD."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister there regularly, according to each day's requirements.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>to present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the LORD, which he had given Israel.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, "for his love endures forever."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Then all the people left, each for his own home, and David returned home to bless his family.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>That night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. "'I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.'"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And as if this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O LORD God.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>O LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And who is like your people Israel-the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"And now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, 'The LORD Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>O LORD, you are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah and Zobah.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>David took the crown from the head of their king -its weight was found to be a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones-and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Take your choice:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD -days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But this word of the LORD came to me: 'You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Now, my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>May the LORD give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You have many workmen: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as men skilled in every kind of work
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>in gold and silver, bronze and iron-craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He said to them, "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his people.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The descendants of Gershom: Shubael was the first.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth-three in all.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>These were the descendants of Levi by their families-the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For David had said, "Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites-one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.

    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, according to their families.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>They also cast lots, just as their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites.
