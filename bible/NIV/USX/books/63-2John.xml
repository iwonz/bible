    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The elder,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.
