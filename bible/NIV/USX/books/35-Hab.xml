    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>How long, O LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Look at the nations and watch- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>they all come bent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then they sweep past like the wind and go on- guilty men, whose own strength is their god."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then the LORD replied: "Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"See, he is puffed up; his desires are not upright- but the righteous will live by his faith -
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, "'Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Will not your debtors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high, to escape the clutches of ruin!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime!
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Has not the LORD Almighty determined that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and be exposed! The cup from the LORD's right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Of what value is an idol, since a man has carved it? Or an image that teaches lies? For he who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>LORD, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, O LORD. Renew them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His splendor was like the sunrise; rays flashed from his hand, where his power was hidden.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Plague went before him; pestilence followed his steps.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He stood, and shook the earth; he looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled and the age-old hills collapsed. His ways are eternal.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Were you angry with the rivers, O LORD? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode with your horses and your victorious chariots?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. Selah You split the earth with rivers;
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, you stripped him from head to foot. Selah
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The Sovereign LORD is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to go on the heights. For the director of music. On my stringed instruments.
