    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He was with God in the beginning.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. "
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not.Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Now some Pharisees who had been sent
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter ).
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied, "My time has not yet come."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. "
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things?
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>(This was before John was put in prison.)
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.'
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He must become greater; I must become less.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."

  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now he had to go through Samaria.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. )
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"I have no husband," she replied.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>And because of his words many more became believers.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>After the two days he left for Galilee.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.

    <verse number="36" style="v"/>"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>I am the bread of life.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever."
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
    <verse number="65" style="v"/>He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."
    <verse number="66" style="v"/>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
    <verse number="67" style="v"/>"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
    <verse number="68" style="v"/>Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
    <verse number="69" style="v"/>We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."
    <verse number="70" style="v"/>Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"
    <verse number="71" style="v"/>(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Others replied, "No, he deceives the people." But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Others said, "He is the Christ."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee? Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>"Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Then each went to his own home.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then they asked him, "Where is your father?"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also." He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"Who are you?" they asked.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied. "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. "
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>You are doing the things your own father does.We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>"You are not yet fifty years old," the Jews said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.

    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God, "they said. "We know this man is a sinner."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me--
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>At these words the Jews were again divided.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The Jews gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>I and the Father are one."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him,
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'?
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken--
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>And in that place many believed in Jesus.

  <chapter number="11" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Jesus wept.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days."
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.

  <chapter number="12" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. "
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Father, glorify your name!"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."

  <chapter number="13" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture: 'He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>"But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>"You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?"
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken,"
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the disciples went back to their homes,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him." At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?No," they answered.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
