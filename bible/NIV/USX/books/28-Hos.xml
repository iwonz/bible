    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, "Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>In that day I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them-not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "Call him Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I am not your God.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited, and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"Say of your brothers, 'My people,' and of your sisters, 'My loved one.'
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold- which they used for Baal.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her nakedness.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days-all her appointed feasts.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot," declares the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me 'my master. '
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"In that day I will respond," declares the LORD - "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called 'Not my loved one. 'I will say to those called 'Not my people, You are my people'; and they will say, 'You are my God.'"

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to me, "Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then I told her, "You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will live with you."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or idol.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>There is only cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Because of this the land mourns, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother-
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their Glory for something disgraceful.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes- a people without understanding will come to ruin!
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Though you commit adultery, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. "Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. And do not swear, 'As surely as the LORD lives!'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; they do not acknowledge the LORD.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Israel's arrogance testifies against them; the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They are unfaithful to the LORD; they give birth to illegitimate children. Now their New Moon festivals will devour them and their fields.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Judah's leaders are like those who move boundary stones. I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Ephraim is oppressed, trampled in judgment, intent on pursuing idols.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rot to the people of Judah.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sores, then Ephraim turned to Assyria, and sent to the great king for help. But he is not able to cure you, not able to heal your sores.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth; my judgments flashed like lightning upon you.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Like Adam, they have broken the covenant- they were unfaithful to me there.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Gilead is a city of wicked men, stained with footprints of blood.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As marauders lie in ambush for a man, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled.

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.
