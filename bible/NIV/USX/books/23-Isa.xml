    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers!
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled- do not forgive them.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>for every trading ship and every stately vessel.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and the idols will totally disappear.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>People will oppress each other- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>the earrings and bracelets and veils,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>the signet rings and nose rings,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: "Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>to those who say, "Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He said, "Go and tell this people: "'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?" And he answered: "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Say to him, 'Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood-because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'It will not take place, it will not happen,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah-he will bring the king of Assyria."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River -the king of Assyria-to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>In that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And because of the abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD spoke to me again:
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River - the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel!"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan-

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>All the people will know it- Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria- who say with pride and arrogance of heart,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But the LORD has strengthened Rezin's foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the LORD Almighty.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So the LORD will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day;
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>the elders and prominent men are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>By the wrath of the LORD Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.

    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore, this is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: "O my people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there- so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.

    <verse number="21" style="v"/>those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob: "No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>until I come and take you to a land like your own-a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard-those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them-the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God. "
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: "The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, 'With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.'
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city," declares the LORD.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>"I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!"
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning-there were all the dead bodies!
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>This is what the LORD says- your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride.

    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Your first father sinned; your spokesmen rebelled against me.
