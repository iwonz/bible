    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
