    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"--
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>At once they left their nets and followed him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The whole town gathered at the door,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Simon and his companions went to look for him,
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
  </para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He appointed twelve--designating them apostles--that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and to have authority to drive out demons.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>so that, "'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The farmer sows the word.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"
  </para>
  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So Jesus went with him.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>But they laughed at him.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!" ).
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
  </para>
  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And he was amazed at their lack of faith.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They went out and preached that people should repent.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist," she answered.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>They all ate and were satisfied,
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>because they all saw him and were terrified.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

  <chapter number="7" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!" ).
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."

  <chapter number="8" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?Twelve," they replied.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village. "
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ. "
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"From childhood," he answered. "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer. "
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>for whoever is not against us is for us.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Everyone will be salted with fire.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"What did Moses command you?" he replied.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!Hosanna in the highest!"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: "'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When evening came, they went out of the city.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But if we say, 'From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Haven't you read this scripture: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Should we pay or shouldn't we?"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it." They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?Caesar's," they replied.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."'
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.

    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Pray that this will not take place in winter,

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Then everyone deserted him and fled.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?"
    <verse number="65" style="v"/>They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.
    <verse number="66" style="v"/>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
    <verse number="67" style="v"/>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.
    <verse number="68" style="v"/>But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.
    <verse number="69" style="v"/>When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."
    <verse number="70" style="v"/>Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
    <verse number="71" style="v"/>He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."
    <verse number="72" style="v"/>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The chief priests accused him of many things.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"Crucify him!" they shouted.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>It was the third hour when they crucified him.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>See Footnote
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>come down from the cross and save yourself!"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
