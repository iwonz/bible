    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He had seven sons and three daughters,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He said:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>That day-may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>That night-may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'
  </para>
  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."

  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Job replied:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas- no wonder my words have been impetuous.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then I would still have this consolation- my joy in unrelenting pain- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?

  <chapter number="7" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>What he trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
  </para>
  <chapter number="9" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Job replied:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.

    <verse number="22" style="v"/>After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For God does speak-now one way, now another- though man may not perceive it.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'-
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"God does all these things to a man- twice, even three times-
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,

    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>he tells them what they have done- that they have sinned arrogantly.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
