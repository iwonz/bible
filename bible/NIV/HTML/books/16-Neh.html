  <h1>Nehemiah</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then I said: "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> "Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> "They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.1.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.12"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.13"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.14"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.15"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.16"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.17"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.18"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.19"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.2.20"><sup><a href="#Neh.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.3.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble-burned as they are?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, "What they are building-if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Also our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.12"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.13"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.14"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.15"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.16"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.17"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.18"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.19"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.20"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.21"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.22"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.4.23"><sup><a href="#Neh.4.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.1"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their Jewish brothers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.2"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Some were saying, "We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.3"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.4"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Still others were saying, "We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.5"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.6"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.7"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.8"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> and said: "As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.9"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> So I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.10"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Neh.5.11"><sup><a href="#Neh.5.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them-the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil."</p>
