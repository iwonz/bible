  <h1>Hebrews</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father "? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> and put everything under his feet.? In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double--edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father. "</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And God permitting, we will do so.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case--things that accompany salvation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.20"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.20"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.21"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.22"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.23"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.24"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.25"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.26"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.27"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.28"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves.

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:</p>
