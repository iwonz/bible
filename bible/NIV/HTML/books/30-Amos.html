  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.1"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa-what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.2"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> He said: "The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, and the top of Carmel withers."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.3"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.6"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.7"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.8"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is dead," says the Sovereign LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.9"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.10"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses."</p>

Because he pursued his brother with a sword, stifling all compassion, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.12"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.13"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not turn back {my wrath}. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.1.14"><sup><a href="#Amos.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.2.5"><sup><a href="#Amos.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.2.6"><sup><a href="#Amos.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Israel, even for four, I will not turn back {my wrath}. They sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.2.7"><sup><a href="#Amos.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> They trample on the heads of the poor as upon the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.2.14"><sup><a href="#Amos.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> The swift will not escape, the strong will not muster their strength, and the warrior will not save his life.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.2.15"><sup><a href="#Amos.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet-footed soldier will not get away, and the horseman will not save his life.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.1"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Hear this word the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel-against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.4"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.5"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.6"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.7"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.8"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> The lion has roared- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken- who can but prophesy?</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.11"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "An enemy will overrun the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.12"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> This is what the LORD says: "As a shepherd saves from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites be saved, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches. "</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.3.13"><sup><a href="#Amos.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> "Hear this and testify against the house of Jacob," declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Amos.4.1"><sup><a href="#Amos.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, "Bring us some drinks!"</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Amos.4.10"><sup><a href="#Amos.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> "I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</p>
