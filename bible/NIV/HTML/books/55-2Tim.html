  <h1>2 Timothy</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.1"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.2"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.3"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.4"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.5"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.6"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.7"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.8"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.9"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.10"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.11"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.12"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.13"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.14"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.15"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.16"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.17"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.1.18"><sup><a href="#2Tim.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.1"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.2"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.3"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.4"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.5"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.6"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.7"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.8"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.9"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.10"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.11"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.12"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.13"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.14"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.15"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.16"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.17"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.18"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.19"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.20"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.21"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.22"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.23"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.24"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.25"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.2.26"><sup><a href="#2Tim.2.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.1"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.2"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.3"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.4"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.5"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.6"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.7"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.8"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.9"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.10"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.11"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.12"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.13"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.14"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.15"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.16"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.3.17"><sup><a href="#2Tim.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.1"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.2"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.3"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.4"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.5"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.6"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.7"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.8"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.9"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Do your best to come to me quickly,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.10"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.11"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.12"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.13"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.14"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.15"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.16"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.17"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.18"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.19"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.20"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2Tim.4.21"><sup><a href="#2Tim.4.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.</p>
