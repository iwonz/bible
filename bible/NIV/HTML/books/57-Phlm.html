  <h1>Philemon</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.1"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.2"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.3"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.4"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.5"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.6"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.7"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.8"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.9"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.10"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.11"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.12"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.13"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.14"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.15"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.16"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.17"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.18"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.19"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.20"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.21"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.22"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.23"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.24"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.25"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
