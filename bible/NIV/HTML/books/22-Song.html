  <h1>Song of Songs</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.1"><sup><a href="#Song.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Solomon's Song of Songs.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.2"><sup><a href="#Song.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth- for your love is more delightful than wine.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.3"><sup><a href="#Song.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.4"><sup><a href="#Song.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Take me away with you-let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.5"><sup><a href="#Song.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.6"><sup><a href="#Song.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.7"><sup><a href="#Song.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.8"><sup><a href="#Song.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.9"><sup><a href="#Song.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.10"><sup><a href="#Song.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.11"><sup><a href="#Song.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.12"><sup><a href="#Song.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.13"><sup><a href="#Song.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.14"><sup><a href="#Song.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.15"><sup><a href="#Song.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.16"><sup><a href="#Song.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.17"><sup><a href="#Song.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.1"><sup><a href="#Song.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.3"><sup><a href="#Song.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.4"><sup><a href="#Song.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.5"><sup><a href="#Song.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.6"><sup><a href="#Song.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.7"><sup><a href="#Song.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.8"><sup><a href="#Song.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.9"><sup><a href="#Song.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.10"><sup><a href="#Song.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> My lover spoke and said to me, "Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come with me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.11"><sup><a href="#Song.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.12"><sup><a href="#Song.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.13"><sup><a href="#Song.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.14"><sup><a href="#Song.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.15"><sup><a href="#Song.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.16"><sup><a href="#Song.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.2.17"><sup><a href="#Song.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.1"><sup><a href="#Song.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.2"><sup><a href="#Song.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.3"><sup><a href="#Song.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.4"><sup><a href="#Song.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who conceived me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.5"><sup><a href="#Song.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.6"><sup><a href="#Song.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Who is this coming up from the desert like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.7"><sup><a href="#Song.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Look! It is Solomon's carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.8"><sup><a href="#Song.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.9"><sup><a href="#Song.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.10"><sup><a href="#Song.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.3.11"><sup><a href="#Song.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Come out, you daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon wearing the crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.1"><sup><a href="#Song.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Mount Gilead.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.2"><sup><a href="#Song.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, coming up from the washing. Each has its twin; not one of them is alone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.3"><sup><a href="#Song.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.4"><sup><a href="#Song.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Your neck is like the tower of David, built with elegance; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.5"><sup><a href="#Song.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.6"><sup><a href="#Song.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.12"><sup><a href="#Song.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.4.13"><sup><a href="#Song.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,</p>

  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.1"><sup><a href="#Song.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.

  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.2"><sup><a href="#Song.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night."</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.4"><sup><a href="#Song.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.5"><sup><a href="#Song.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> I arose to open for my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.6"><sup><a href="#Song.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> I opened for my lover, but my lover had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.5.7"><sup><a href="#Song.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.6.9"><sup><a href="#Song.6.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.6.11"><sup><a href="#Song.6.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.6.12"><sup><a href="#Song.6.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.5"><sup><a href="#Song.8.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.6"><sup><a href="#Song.8.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.7"><sup><a href="#Song.8.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.8"><sup><a href="#Song.8.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> We have a young sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.11"><sup><a href="#Song.8.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.12"><sup><a href="#Song.8.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.13"><sup><a href="#Song.8.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.8.14"><sup><a href="#Song.8.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Come away, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.</p>
