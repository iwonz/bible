  <h1>2 John</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.1"><sup><a href="#2John.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The elder,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.2"><sup><a href="#2John.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.3"><sup><a href="#2John.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.4"><sup><a href="#2John.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.5"><sup><a href="#2John.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.6"><sup><a href="#2John.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.7"><sup><a href="#2John.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.8"><sup><a href="#2John.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.9"><sup><a href="#2John.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.10"><sup><a href="#2John.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.11"><sup><a href="#2John.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.12"><sup><a href="#2John.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.13"><sup><a href="#2John.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</p>
