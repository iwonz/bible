  <h1>Isaiah</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.1"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.2"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.3"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.4"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.5"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.6"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.7"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.8"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.9"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.10"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.11"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> "The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.12"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.13"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.14"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.15"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.16"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.17"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.18"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> "Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.19"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.20"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.21"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.22"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.23"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.24"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.25"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.26"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.27"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.28"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.29"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.29" class="verse-number">29</a></sup> "You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.30"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.1.31"><sup><a href="#Isa.1.31" class="verse-number">31</a></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.1"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.2"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.3"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.4"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.5"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.6"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.7"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.8"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.9"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled- do not forgive them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.10"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.11"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.12"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.13"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.14"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.15"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.16"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> for every trading ship and every stately vessel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.17"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.18"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> and the idols will totally disappear.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.19"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.20"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.21"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.2.22"><sup><a href="#Isa.2.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.1"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.2"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.3"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.4"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.5"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> People will oppress each other- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.6"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.7"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.8"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.9"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.10"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.12"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.13"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.14"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.15"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.16"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.17"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.18"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.19"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> the earrings and bracelets and veils,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.23"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.24"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.25"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.3.26"><sup><a href="#Isa.3.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.1"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.2"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.3"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.4"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.5"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.4.6"><sup><a href="#Isa.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.1"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.2"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.3"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> "Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.6"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.7"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.9"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: "Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.10"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.11"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.12"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.13"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.14"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.15"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Isa.5.20"><sup><a href="#Isa.5.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</p>
