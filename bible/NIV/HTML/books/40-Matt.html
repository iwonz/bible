  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.11"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.12"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.17"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.18"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.19"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.20"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.21"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.22"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.23"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.24"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.1.25"><sup><a href="#Matt.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.1"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.2"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.3"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.4"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.5"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.6"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> "'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.7"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.8"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.9"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.10"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.11"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.12"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.13"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.14"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.15"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.16"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.17"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.18"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.19"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.20"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.21"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.22"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.2.23"><sup><a href="#Matt.2.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.1"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.2"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.3"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.4"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.5"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.6"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.7"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.8"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.9"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.10"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.11"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.12"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.13"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.14"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.15"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.16"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.3.17"><sup><a href="#Matt.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.1"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.2"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.3"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.4"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.5"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.6"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.7"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.8"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.9"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.10"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.11"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.12"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.13"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.14"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.15"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.16"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.17"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.18"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.19"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.20"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.21"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.22"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.23"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Matt.4.25"><sup><a href="#Matt.4.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Matt.5.1"><sup><a href="#Matt.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,</p>
