  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> "This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: "'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites-everyone whose heart God had moved-prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening sacrifices.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, though the foundation of the LORD's temple had not yet been laid.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work, appointing Levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.9"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Jeshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah ) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers-all Levites-joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the LORD, as prescribed by David king of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: "He is good; his love to Israel endures forever." And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, "Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, "You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes.

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.16"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.17"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.18"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.19"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.20"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.21"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.22"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.23"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> and prayed: "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> "But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.9"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> "But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> "What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.14"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.15"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites-men, women and children-gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.9"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.14"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.15"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.16"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.17"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.</p>
