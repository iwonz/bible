en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.13,Phil 1:13,12,so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.14,Phil 1:14,13,"And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."

en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.20,Phil 1:20,19,"as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.21,Phil 1:21,20,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.22,Phil 1:22,21,"If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.23,Phil 1:23,22,"I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.24,Phil 1:24,23,But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.

en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.28,Phil 1:28,27,"and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.29,Phil 1:29,28,"For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,"
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.1,Phil 1,0,Phil.1.30,Phil 1:30,29,engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.2,Phil 2,1,Phil.2.1,Phil 2:1,0,"So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,"

en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.2,Phil 2,1,Phil.2.6,Phil 2:6,5,"who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,"
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.2,Phil 2,1,Phil.2.7,Phil 2:7,6,"but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form,"
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.2,Phil 2,1,Phil.2.8,Phil 2:8,7,"he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."
en,ESV,Phil,Phil,49,Phil.2,Phil 2,1,Phil.2.9,Phil 2:9,8,"Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,"
