en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.8,2Pet 1:8,7,"For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.9,2Pet 1:9,8,"For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.10,2Pet 1:10,9,"Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall."

en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.16,2Pet 1:16,15,"For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.1,2Pet 1,0,2Pet.1.17,2Pet 1:17,16,"For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, ""This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,"""

en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.10,2Pet 2:10,9,"and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority. Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones,"
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.11,2Pet 2:11,10,"whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.12,2Pet 2:12,11,"But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction,"
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.13,2Pet 2:13,12,"suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.14,2Pet 2:14,13,"They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!"
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.15,2Pet 2:15,14,"Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,"
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.16,2Pet 2:16,15,but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.

en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.20,2Pet 2:20,19,"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."
en,ESV,2Pet,2Pet,60,2Pet.2,2Pet 2,1,2Pet.2.21,2Pet 2:21,20,For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
