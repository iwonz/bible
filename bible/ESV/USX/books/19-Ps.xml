    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.

    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.

    <verse number="29" style="v"/>For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>This God- his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?-
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation-
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.

    <verse number="34" style="v"/>When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.

    <verse number="41" style="v"/>They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

    <verse number="43" style="v"/>when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the Sea, at the Red Sea.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Therefore he said he would destroy them- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
