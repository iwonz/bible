    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine;
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green;
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>My beloved speaks and says to me: "Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>for behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The fig tree ripens its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on cleft mountains.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>On my bed by nightI sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but found him not.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The watchmen found me as they went about in the city. "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>What is that coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of a merchant?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men, some of the mighty men of Israel,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>all of them wearing swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against terror by night.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Your neck is like the tower of David, built in rows of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that graze among the lilies.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices-
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I had put off my garment; how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The watchmen found me as they went about in the city; they beat me, they bruised me, they took away my veil, those watchmen of the walls.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, sitting beside a full pool.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. His lips are lilies, dripping liquid myrrh.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>His arms are rods of gold, set with jewels. His body is polished ivory, bedecked with sapphires.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me- Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights!
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages;
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>O you who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice; let me hear it.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
