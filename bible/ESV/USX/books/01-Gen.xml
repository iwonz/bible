    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth." And it was so.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And God made the two great lights- the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night- and the stars.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds- livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And God blessed them. And God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up- for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground-
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>To the woman he said, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever-"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the LORD said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So the LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then God said to Noah,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh- birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth- that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And you, be fruitful and multiply, teem on the earth and multiply in it."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>he said, "Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was 100 years old, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Reu lived after he fathered Serug 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And Serug lived after he fathered Nahor 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, "I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.)
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share."

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Abram said, "Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: "This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And he brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess."

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Sarai said to Abram, "Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please." Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress and submit to her."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the angel of the LORD said to her, "Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "You are a God of seeing," for she said, "Truly here I have seen him who looks after me."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, "Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>God said, "No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.

    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and said, "O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on- since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>They said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "She is in the tent."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The LORD said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Abraham answered and said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Again he spoke to him and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the town square."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But they said, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And as they brought them out, one said, "Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there- is it not a little one?- and my life will be saved!"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, "Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you did this thing?"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But God said to Abraham, "Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, "Let me not look on the death of the child." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And Abraham said, "I will swear."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He said, "These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here am I."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Isaac said to his father Abraham, "My father!" And he said, "Here am I, my son." He said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Abraham said, "God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they went both of them together.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here am I."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So Abraham called the name of that place, "The LORD will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and said, "By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now after these things it was told to Abraham, "Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The Hittites answered Abraham,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he said to them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Ephron answered Abraham,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Abraham said to him, "See to it that you do not take my son back there.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And he said, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'- let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water to drink from your jar."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>She said, "Drink, my lord." And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and said, "Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>She added, "We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He said, "Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." He said, "Speak on."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.'
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>"I came today to the spring and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go,
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, "Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>and who will say to me, "Drink, and I will draw for your camels also," let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>"Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, "The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go."
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>They said, "Let us call the young woman and ask her."
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>And they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will go."
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them!"
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel
    <verse number="65" style="v"/>and said to the servant, "Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.
    <verse number="66" style="v"/>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
    <verse number="67" style="v"/>Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to be his wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The children struggled together within her, and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve the younger."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.

    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Isaac settled in Gerar.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he feared to say, "My wife," thinking, "lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah," because she was attractive in appearance.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, "For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>From there he went up to Beersheba.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake."

    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, "We have found water."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, "My son"; and he answered, "Here I am."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>He said, "Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So he went in to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God granted me success."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then he said, "Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, "Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing."
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?"
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: "Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away-
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?"
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?"

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, "You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, "You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you."

  <chapter number="29" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where do you come from?" They said, "We are from Haran."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" They said, "We know him."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He said to them, "Is it well with him?" They said, "It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>He said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh!" And he stayed with him a month.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Laban said, "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, "Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also." And she called his name Simeon.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore his name was called Levi.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall die!"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then she said, "Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son." Therefore she called his name Dan.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed." So she called his name Naphtali.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Leah said, "Good fortune has come!" so she called his name Gad.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Leah said, "Happy am I! For women have called me happy." So she called his name Asher.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel said, "Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Leah said, "God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband." So she called his name Issachar.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons." So she called his name Zebulun.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>She conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And she called his name Joseph, saying, "May the LORD add to me another son!"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Name your wages, and I will give it."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>He said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, "Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and said to them, "I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>You know that I have served your father with all my strength,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the household gods.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me."
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed,
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>and Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's camp!" So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>thinking, "If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>He instructed the first, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.'"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and you shall say, 'Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.'"For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, "Who are these with you?" Jacob said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company that I met?" Jacob answered, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus he urged him, and he took it.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Esau said, "Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this girl for my wife."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing must not be done.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Ask me for as great a bride price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Only on this condition will we agree with you- that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father's house.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people- when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But they said, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he called his name Israel.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for you have another son."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Jacob lived in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>He said to them, "Hear this dream that I have dreamed:
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word." So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"I am seeking my brothers," he said. "Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to ki i him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him"- that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers listened to him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>and returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?"
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, "This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>And he identified it and said, "It is my son's robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father wept for him.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up"- for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father's house.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And when Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He turned to her at the roadside and said, "Come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>He answered, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." And she said, "If you give me a pledge, until you send it-"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And he asked the men of the place, "Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside?" And they said, "No cult prostitute has been here."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So he returned to Judah and said, "I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, 'No cult prostitute has been here.'"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And Judah replied, "Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>About three months later Judah was told, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality." And Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, "By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant." And she said, "Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then Judah identified them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know her again.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" Therefore his name was called Perez.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, "Lie with me."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>and she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, "This is the way your servant treated me," his anger was kindled.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And one night they both dreamed- the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison- each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head- from you!- and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my offenses today.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you."
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly,
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>The name of the second he called Ephraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. "Where do you come from?" he said. They said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, "You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>They said to him, "No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He said to them, "No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And they said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you. You are spies.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And he put them all together in custody for three days.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die." And they did so.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then they said to one another, "In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Reuben answered them, "Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He said to his brothers, "My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!" At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we have never been spies.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me."
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Then Reuben said to his father, "Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you."
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the famine was severe in the land.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little food."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But Judah said to him, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They replied, "The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and said, "Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>He replied, "Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And he inquired about their welfare and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, "Serve the food."
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then he commanded the steward of his house, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph told him.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord's servants."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>He said, "Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?"
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then Judah went up to him and said, "O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>One left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces, and I have never seen him since.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>"Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.'
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, "Make everyone go out from me." So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." And they came near. And he said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry.

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.'
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, "Joseph's brothers have come," it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the way."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And they told him, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Joseph answered, "Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh's.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And they said, "You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place." He answered, "I will do as you have said."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And he said, "Swear to me"; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After this, Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is ill." So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And it was told to Jacob, "Your son Joseph has come to you." Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.'
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn).
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he blessed Joseph and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Joseph said to his father, "Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.'"Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to Israel your father.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the firstfruits of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it- he went up to my couch!
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Let my soul come not into their council; O my glory, be not joined to their company. For in their anger they killed men, and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down before you.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Judah is a lion's cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; he shall become a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sidon.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"Issachar is a strong donkey, crouching between the sheepfolds.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant, so he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant at forced labor.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse's heels so that his rider falls backward.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>I wait for your salvation, O LORD.

    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The archers bitterly attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him severely,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>yet his bow remained unmoved; his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>by the God of your father who will help you, by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The blessings of your father are mighty beyond the blessings of my parents, up to the bounties of the everlasting hills. May they be on the head of Joseph, and on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey and at evening dividing the spoil."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then he commanded them and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah-
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Joseph fell on his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>My father made me swear, saying, 'I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Pharaoh answered, "Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians." Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>'Say to Joseph, Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But Joseph said to them, "Do not fear, for am I in the place of God?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones." Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph's own.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
