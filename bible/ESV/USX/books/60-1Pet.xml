    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, as was necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>so that the tested genuineness of your faith- more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire- may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>since it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for your sake,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>for "All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>but the word of the Lord remains forever." And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation-
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For it stands in Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives-
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>when they see your respectful and pure conduct.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Do not let your adorning be external- the braiding of hair, the wearing of gold, or the putting on of clothing-
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their husbands,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For "Whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>but in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace:
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies- in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And "If the righteous is scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.

  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Greet one another with the kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
