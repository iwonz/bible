    <verse number="1" style="v"/>These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this, and let the male children live?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, "Because," she said, "I drew him out of the water."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, "Why do you strike your companion?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He answered, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, and thought, "Surely the thing is known."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, "How is it that you have come home so soon today?"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He said to his daughters, "Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>God saw the people of Israel- and God knew.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Moses said, "I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then he said, "Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then the LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey."'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians."

  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Moses answered, "But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The LORD did not appear to you.'"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A staff."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And he said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the LORD said to Moses, "Put out your hand and catch it by the tail"- so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand-
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Again, the LORD said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then God said, "Put your hand back inside your cloak." So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"If they will not believe you," God said, "or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But Moses said to the LORD, "Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But he said, "Oh, my Lord, please send someone else."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, "Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and I say to you, "Let my son go that he may serve me." If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it and said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So he let him alone. It was then that she said, "A bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, "Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, "Why do you treat your servants like this?
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But he said, "You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, "You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>and they said to them, "The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, "O LORD, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all."

  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>But the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt: to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the clans of Reuben.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the clans of Simeon.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137 years.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their generations.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Amram took as his wife Jochebed his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the years of the life of Amram being 137 years.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Aaron took as his wife Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the clans of the Korahites.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Eleazar, Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their clans.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>These are the Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said: "Bring out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>the LORD said to Moses, "I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?"

  <chapter number="7" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Prove yourselves by working a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And you shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. But so far, you have not obeyed."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile."'"
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and say to him,'Thus says the LORD, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants."'"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt!'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, "Plead with the LORD to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses said to Pharaoh, "Be pleased to command me when I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And he said, "Tomorrow." Moses said, "Be it as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen."'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>But Moses said, "It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>behold, the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die."'"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the LORD set a time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the next day the LORD did this thing. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them."'"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, "This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Plead with the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>(The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.)
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'"Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But he said to them, "The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you are asking." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the people of Israel had light where they lived.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh called Moses and said, "Go, serve the LORD; your little ones also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me; take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die."

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD's Passover.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses. If anyone eats what is leavened, that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And when you come to the land that the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of the LORD's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.'"And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, "Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!"
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, "We shall all be dead."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>It was a night of watching by the LORD, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>No foreigner or hired servant may eat of it.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised. Then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you."
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>All the people of Israel did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this service in this month.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>You shall tell your son on that day, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD's.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And when in time to come your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall say to him, 'By strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, "Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp facing it, by the sea.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, 'They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD." And they did so.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the people of Israel while the people of Israel were going out defiantly.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pihahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>They said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Moses said to the people, "Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The LORD is a man of war; the LORD is his name.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea, and his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The floods covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power, your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries; you send out your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up; the floods stood up in a heap; the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them. I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>You blew with your wind; the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>You stretched out your right hand; the earth swallowed them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed; you have guided them by your strength to your holy abode.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The peoples have heard; they tremble; pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed; trembling seizes the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Terror and dread fall upon them; because of the greatness of your arm, they are still as a stone, till your people, O LORD, pass by, till the people pass by whom you have purchased.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain, the place, O LORD, which you have made for your abode, the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The LORD will reign forever and ever."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And he cried to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made for them a statute and a rule, and there he tested them,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>saying, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, your healer."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there by the water.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and the people of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "At evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For what are we, that you grumble against us?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him- what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.'"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it over till the morning."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>he said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>So the people rested on the seventh day.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Moses cried to the LORD, "What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink." And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD is my banner,

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land"),
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh").
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And when he sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,"
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God;
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses. "Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to look and many of them perish.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, 'Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the LORD said to him, "Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So Moses went down to the people and told them.

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And you shall put it in front of the veil that is above the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy seat that is above the testimony, where I will meet with you.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it. Every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>and when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a regular incense offering before the LORD throughout your generations.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>You shall not offer unauthorized incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering, and you shall not pour a drink offering on it.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year. With the blood of the sin offering of atonement he shall make atonement for it once in the year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"When you take the census of the people of Israel, then each shall give a ransom for his life to the LORD when you number them, that there be no plague among them when you number them.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Each one who is numbered in the census shall give this: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as an offering to the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Everyone who is numbered in the census, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the LORD's offering.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when you give the LORD's offering to make atonement for your lives.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>You shall take the atonement money from the people of Israel and shall give it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may bring the people of Israel to remembrance before the LORD, so as to make atonement for your lives."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"You shall also make a basin of bronze, with its stand of bronze, for washing. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>with which Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to burn a food offering to the LORD, they shall wash with water, so that they may not die.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die. It shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his offspring throughout their generations."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of aromatic cane,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils and the basin and its stand.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>You shall consecrate them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them will become holy.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And you shall say to the people of Israel, 'This shall be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>It shall not be poured on the body of an ordinary person, and you shall make no other like it in composition. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Whoever compounds any like it or whoever puts any of it on an outsider shall be cut off from his people.'"
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense (of each shall there be an equal part),
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>You shall beat some of it very small, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with you. It shall be most holy for you.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>And the incense that you shall make according to its composition, you shall not make for yourselves. It shall be for you holy to the LORD.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume shall be cut off from his people."

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every craft.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And I have given to all able men ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you:

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him, "Up, make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So Aaron said to them, "Take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf. And they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!'"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them, in order that I may make a great nation of you."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But Moses implored the LORD his God and said, "O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But he said, "It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>He took the calf that they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Aaron said, "Let not the anger of my lord burn hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For they said to me, 'Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So I said to them, 'Let any who have gold take it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to the derision of their enemies),
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me." And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.'"
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And Moses said, "Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day."
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Alas, this people have sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But now, if you will forgive their sin- but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>Then the LORD sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.

  <chapter number="33" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.'
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the people of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.'"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Moses said to the LORD, "See, you say to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And he said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And he said to him, "If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Moses said, "Please show me your glory."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."

  <chapter number="34" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The LORD said to Moses, "Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And he said, "Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Take care, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you go, lest it become a snare in your midst.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>(for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>All that open the womb are mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty-handed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>For I will cast out nations before you and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Moses, "Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

    <verse number="29" style="v"/>All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and said to Moses, "The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do."

    <verse number="7" style="v"/>for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked.

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Moses erected the tabernacle. He laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
