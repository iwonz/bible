    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you- I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother- especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it- to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
