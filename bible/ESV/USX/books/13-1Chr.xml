    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with making the flat cakes.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Also some of their kinsmen of the Kohathites had charge of the showbread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Now these, the singers, the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, were in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty day and night.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>These were heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, according to their generations, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>David said, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander." And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>This is an account of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved them by a great victory.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And David said longingly, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the LORD
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and said, "Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, O David, and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your God helps you." Then David received them and made them officers of his troops.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, "At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul.")
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were commanders in the army.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the LORD.

    <verse number="39" style="v"/>And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark, and he died there before God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.

    <verse number="42" style="v"/>Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD: It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O LORD God!
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For your servant's sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And now, O LORD, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God,' and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O LORD, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever."

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze. With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>These also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines and Amalek.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And David said, "I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But Joab said, "May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?"
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Go and say to David, 'Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Choose what you will:
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house. But do not let the plague be on your people."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Now the angel of the LORD had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD- give it to me at its full price- that the plague may be averted from the people."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Ornan said to David, "Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and work! The LORD be with you!"
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father's house.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the LORD and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kinsmen, the sons of Kish, married them.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of fathers' houses as they were listed according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Their duty was also to assist with the showbread, the flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising the LORD, and likewise at evening,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the LORD on Sabbaths, new moons and feast days, according to the number required of them, regularly before the LORD.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Thus they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and to attend the sons of Aaron, their brothers, for the service of the house of the LORD.

    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And David the king said to all the assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: "Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then David said to all the assembly, "Bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And they offered sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>And the LORD made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
