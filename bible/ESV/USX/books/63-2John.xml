    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And now I ask you, dear lady- not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning- that we love one another.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The children of your elect sister greet you.
