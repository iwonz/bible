    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the LORD."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see an almond branch."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you."

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, "I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest. All who ate of it incurred guilt; disaster came upon them, declares the LORD."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>They did not say, 'Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the shepherds transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"Therefore I still contend with you, declares the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Be appalled, O heavens, at this; be shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the LORD,
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The lions have roared against him; they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And now what do you gain by going to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Your evil will chastise you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"For long ago I broke your yoke and burst your bonds; but you said, 'I will not serve.' yes, on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down like a whore.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the Lord GOD.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>How can you say, 'I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done- a restless young camel running here and there,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is hopeless, for I have loved foreigners, and after them I will go.'
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>"As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' and to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, 'Arise and save us!'
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Why do you contend with me? You have all transgressed against me, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>In vain have I struck your children; they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, 'We are free, we will come no more to you'?
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"How well you direct your course to seek love! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, 'I have not sinned.'
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>How much you go about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>From it too you will come away with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not that land be greatly polluted? You have played the whore with many lovers; and would you return to me? declares the LORD.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have the forehead of a whore; you refuse to be ashamed.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Have you not just now called to me, 'My father, you are the friend of my youth-
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>will he be angry forever, will he be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah: "Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the whore?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And I thought, 'After she has done all this she will return to me,' but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, "' Return, faithless Israel, declares the LORD. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, declares the LORD; I will not be angry forever.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Only acknowledge your guilt, that you rebelled against the LORD your God and scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree, and that you have not obeyed my voice, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Return, O faithless children, declares the LORD; for I am your master; I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"'And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>"'I said How I would set you among my sons, and give you a pleasant land, a heritage most beautiful of all nations. And I thought you would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband, so have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel, declares the LORD.'"
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>A voice on the bare heights is heard, the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"Return, O faithless sons; I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to you, for you are the LORD our God.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Truly the hills are a delusion, the orgies on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"If you return, O Israel, declares the LORD, to me you should return. If you remove your detestable things from my presence, and do not waver,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and if you swear, 'As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet through the land; cry aloud and say, 'Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!'
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, stay not, for I bring disaster from the north, and great destruction.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>A lion has gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For this put on sackcloth, lament, and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"In that day, declares the LORD, courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It shall be well with you,' whereas the sword has reached their very life."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Behold, he comes up like clouds; his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles- woe to us, for we are ruined!
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil, that you may be saved. How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Warn the nations that he is coming; announce to Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Like keepers of a field are they against her all around, because she has rebelled against me, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent, for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Crash follows hard on crash; the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>"For my people are foolish; they know me not; they are stupid children; they have no understanding. They are 'wise'- in doing evil! But how to do good they know not."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark; for I have spoken; I have purposed; I have not relented, nor will I turn back."
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note! Search her squares to see if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth, that I may pardon her.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Though they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then I said, "These are only the poor; they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I will go to the great and will speak to them, for they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God." But they all alike had broken the yoke; they had burst the bonds.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down; a wolf from the desert shall devastate them. A leopard is watching their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of whores.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor's wife.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD; and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Go up through her vine rows and destroy, but make not a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the LORD's.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous to me, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>They have spoken falsely of the LORD and have said, 'He will do nothing; no disaster will come upon us, nor shall we see sword or famine.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The prophets will become wind; the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!'"
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: "Because you have spoken this word, behold, I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall consume them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Behold, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, declares the LORD. It is an enduring nation; it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Their quiver is like an open tomb; they are all mighty warriors.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; your fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"But even in those days, declares the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And when your people say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.'"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but see not, who have ears, but hear not.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Do you not fear me? declares the LORD; Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>They do not say in their hearts, 'Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest.'
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have kept good from you.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For wicked men are found among my people; they lurk like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and rich;
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>they have grown fat and sleek. They know no bounds in deeds of evil; they judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their direction; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Flee for safety, O people of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem, for disaster looms out of the north, and great destruction.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The lovely and delicately bred I will destroy, the daughter of Zion.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents around her; they shall pasture, each in his place.

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Arise, and let us attack by night and destroy her palaces!"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD of hosts: "Cut down her trees; cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her evil; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I turn from you in disgust, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land."
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD of hosts: "They shall glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer pass your hand again over its branches."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, they cannot listen; behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. "Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men, also; both husband and wife shall be taken, the elderly and the very aged.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown," says the LORD.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD: "Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Pay attention to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not pay attention.'
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing disaster upon this people, the fruit of their devices, because they have not paid attention to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.

    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And you shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And after many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"You shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.'"
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD has spoken.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Say to the king and the queen mother: "Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.

    <verse number="21" style="v"/>What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you like those of a woman in labor?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up and you suffer violence.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd whorings, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?"

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For whenever I speak, I cry out, I shout, "Violence and destruction!" For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>If I say, "I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name," there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! "Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" say all my close friends, watching for my fall. "Perhaps he will be deceived; then we can overcome him and take our revenge on him."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble; they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, "A son is born to you," making him very glad.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Let that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb forever great.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Why did I come out from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?

He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.'

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Weep not for him who is dead, nor grieve for him, but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land.

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "' Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.

    <verse number="5" style="v"/>"It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"'"But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortunetellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD."'"
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you."

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?

    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem-
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place."

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.

    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years." But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:

    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>You will seek me and find me. When you seek me with all your heart,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>"Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>'Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.

    <verse number="19" style="v"/>because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.'
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, declares the LORD.'"
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>'The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce."'"
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants.

    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed'?"
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.'
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>'Ah, Lord GOD! It is you who has made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"- though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.'"
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me?
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger- their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>"Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence':
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their own good and the good of their children after them.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>"For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, 'It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it- the LORD is his name:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and against the sword:
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, 'It is a waste without man or beast,' in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD: "' Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!' For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place that is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.'
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me."
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Have you not observed that these people are saying, 'The LORD has rejected the two clans that he chose'? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth,
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: 'You shall not die by the sword.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, "Alas, lord!"'For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>'At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.' But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts-
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>But they answered, "We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, 'You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.' So we are living in Jerusalem."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, 'Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, "I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And they said to him, "Sit down and read it." So Baruch read it to them.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go away.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Jeremiah said, "It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then the officials said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern- the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate-
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, "Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Jeremiah said, "You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, "' Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mud, they turn away from you.'
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>then you shall say to them, 'I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah.

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you."

    <verse number="2" style="v"/>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.

If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, "Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."

    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except some fugitives."
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But since we left off making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine."
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>And the women said, "When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands' approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer:
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind?
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day."
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, 'We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.' Then confirm your vows and perform your vows!
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, 'As the Lord GOD lives.'
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>This shall be the sign to you, declares the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, in order that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for harm:
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Thus says the LORD, behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life."

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Raise a shout against her all around; she has surrendered; her bulwarks have fallen; her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the one who handles the sickle in time of harvest; because of the sword of the oppressor, every one shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing punishment on the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and his desire shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In those days and in that time, declares the LORD, iniquity shall be sought in Israel, and there shall be none. And sin in Judah, and none shall be found, for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Go up against the land of Merathaim, and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Kill, and devote them to destruction, declares the LORD, and do all that I have commanded you.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction!
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I set a snare for you and you were taken, O Babylon, and you did not know it; you were found and caught, because you opposed the LORD.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>The LORD has opened his armory and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Come against her from every quarter; open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain, and devote her to destruction; let nothing be left of her.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time of their punishment.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"A voice! They flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, vengeance for his temple.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her according to all that she has done. For she has proudly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, declares the LORD.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"Behold, I am against you, O proud one, declares the Lord GOD of hosts, for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>The proud one shall stumble and fall, with none to raise him up, and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all that is around him.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah with them. All who took them captive have held them fast; they refuse to let them go.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will surely plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>"A sword against the Chaldeans, declares the LORD, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her officials and her wise men!
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>A sword against the diviners, that they may become fools! A sword against her warriors, that they may be destroyed!
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>A sword against her horses and against her chariots, and against all the foreign troops in her midst, that they may become women! A sword against all her treasures, that they may be plundered!
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>A drought against her waters, that they may be dried up! For it is a land of images, and they are mad over idols.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>"Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall dwell in her. She shall never again have people, nor be inhabited for all generations.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, declares the LORD, so no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn in her.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>"Behold, a people comes from the north; a mighty nation and many kings are stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy. The sound of them is like the roaring of the sea; they ride on horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon!
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>"The king of Babylon heard the report of them, and his hands fell helpless; anguish seized him, pain as of a woman in labor.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>"Behold, like a lion coming up from the thicket of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make them run away from her, and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me?
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Babylon, and the purposes that he has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the little ones of their flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations."

    <verse number="4" style="v"/>They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and wounded in her streets.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD of hosts, but the land of the Chaldeans is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>"Flee from the midst of Babylon; let every one save his life! Be not cut off in her punishment, for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance, the repayment he is rendering her.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>We would have healed Babylon, but she was not healed. Forsake her, and let us go each to his own country, for her judgment has reached up to heaven and has been lifted up even to the skies.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The LORD has brought about our vindication; come, let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Sharpen the arrows! Take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; set up watchmen; prepare the ambushes; for the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come; the thread of your life is cut.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself: Surely I will fill you with men, as many as locusts, and they shall raise the shout of victory over you.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.

    <verse number="27" style="v"/>"Set up a standard on the earth; blow the trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations for war against her; summon against her the kingdoms, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a marshal against her; bring up horses like bristling locusts.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Prepare the nations for war against her, the kings of the Medes, with their governors and deputies, and every land under their dominion.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>The land trembles and writhes in pain, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds; their strength has failed; they have become women; her dwellings are on fire; her bars are broken.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side;
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>the fords have been seized, the marshes are burned with fire, and the soldiers are in panic.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while and the time of her harvest will come."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a monster; he has filled his stomach with my delicacies; he has rinsed me out.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon," let the inhabitant of Zion say. "My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," let Jerusalem say.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Therefore thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry,
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins, the haunt of jackals, a horror and a hissing, without inhabitant.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>"They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions' cubs.

    <verse number="41" style="v"/>"How Babylon is taken, the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>The sea has come up on Babylon; she is covered with its tumultuous waves.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>Her cities have become a horror, a land of drought and a desert, a land in which no one dwells, and through which no son of man passes.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and take out of his mouth what he has swallowed. The nations shall no longer flow to him; the wall of Babylon has fallen.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>"Go out of the midst of her, my people! Let every one save his life from the fierce anger of the LORD!
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>Let not your heart faint, and be not fearful at the report heard in the land, when a report comes in one year and afterward a report in another year, and violence is in the land, and ruler is against ruler.

    <verse number="48" style="v"/>Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall sing for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north, declares the LORD.

    <verse number="50" style="v"/>"You who have escaped from the sword, go, do not stand still! Remember the LORD from far away, and let Jerusalem come into your mind:

    <verse number="53" style="v"/>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strong height, yet destroyers would come from me against her, declares the LORD.

    <verse number="55" style="v"/>For the LORD is laying Babylon waste and stilling her mighty voice. Their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is raised,
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>for a destroyer has come upon her, upon Babylon; her warriors are taken; their bows are broken in pieces, for the LORD is a God of recompense; he will surely repay.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>I will make drunk her officials and her wise men, her governors, her commanders, and her warriors; they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: The broad wall of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground, and her high gates shall be burned with fire. The peoples labor for nothing, and the nations weary themselves only for fire."
    <verse number="59" style="v"/>The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.
    <verse number="60" style="v"/>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
    <verse number="61" style="v"/>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: "When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
    <verse number="62" style="v"/>and say, 'O LORD, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be desolate forever.'
    <verse number="63" style="v"/>When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates,
    <verse number="64" style="v"/>and say, 'Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall become exhausted.'"Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For because of the anger of the LORD things came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month- that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon- Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the dishes for incense and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>And the king of Babylon struck them down, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>And he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death as long as he lived.
