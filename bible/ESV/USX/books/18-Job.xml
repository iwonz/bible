  <chapter number="1" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for no reason?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>and there came a messenger to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.

  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Job said:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>That night- let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'

  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>"Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Job answered and said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>"He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>"But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>"Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>"Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>visit him every morning and test him every moment?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>"For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."

  <chapter number="9" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Job answered and said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>He is wise in heart and mighty in strength- who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?-
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause;
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges- if it is not he, who then is it?
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>"My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,'
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,

    <verse number="6" style="v"/>when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.

    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation;

    <verse number="29" style="v"/>I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.'
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.

    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.

    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;

    <verse number="20" style="v"/>so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom;
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor';
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>"Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Elihu answered and said:
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>"Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.'
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>"Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath,

    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,'
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>"For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see,
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways,
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted-
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?-
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more;
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know.
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say:
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.'
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men.

    <verse number="14" style="v"/>How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression,

    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
