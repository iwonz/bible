    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge-
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you-
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>What I mean is that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," or "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ."
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart."
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom and our righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>Therefore, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
  </para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him"-
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>"For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
  </para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not being merely human?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw-
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness,"
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile."
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future- all are yours,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
  </para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless,
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>I urge you, then, be imitators of me.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
  </para>
  <chapter number="5" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people-
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler- not even to eat with such a one.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>God judges those outside. "Purge the evil person from among you."
  </para>
  <chapter number="6" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But you yourselves wrong and defraud- even your own brothers!
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be enslaved by anything.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>"Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food"- and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, "The two will become one flesh."
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.
  </para>
  <chapter number="7" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman."
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods,
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry- it is no sin.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
  </para>
  <chapter number="8" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us possess knowledge." This "knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one."
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth- as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"-
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
  </para>
  <chapter number="9" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>This is my defense to those who would examine me.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.

  <chapter number="10" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>and all ate the same spiritual food,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play."
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>"All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful," but not all things build up.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof."
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience-
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.

  <chapter number="11" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head- it is the same as if her head were shaven.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part,
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another-
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home- so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.

  <chapter number="12" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says "Jesus is accursed!" and no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body- Jews or Greeks, slaves or free- and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If all were a single member, where would the body be?
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.

  <chapter number="13" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
  </para>
  <chapter number="14" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say "Amen" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>In the Law it is written, "By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent.
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged,
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>But all things should be done decently and in order.
  </para>
  <chapter number="15" style="c"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you- unless you believed in vain.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.
    <verse number="25" style="v"/>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
    <verse number="26" style="v"/>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
    <verse number="27" style="v"/>For "God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when it says, "all things are put in subjection," it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.
    <verse number="28" style="v"/>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.
    <verse number="29" style="v"/>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?
    <verse number="30" style="v"/>Why am I in danger every hour?
    <verse number="31" style="v"/>I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!
    <verse number="32" style="v"/>What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
    <verse number="33" style="v"/>Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."
    <verse number="34" style="v"/>Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
    <verse number="35" style="v"/>But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?"
    <verse number="36" style="v"/>You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
    <verse number="37" style="v"/>And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
    <verse number="38" style="v"/>But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
    <verse number="39" style="v"/>For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
    <verse number="40" style="v"/>There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another.
    <verse number="41" style="v"/>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
    <verse number="42" style="v"/>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.
    <verse number="43" style="v"/>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
    <verse number="44" style="v"/>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
    <verse number="45" style="v"/>Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
    <verse number="46" style="v"/>But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
    <verse number="47" style="v"/>The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.
    <verse number="48" style="v"/>As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.
    <verse number="49" style="v"/>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.
    <verse number="50" style="v"/>I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
    <verse number="51" style="v"/>Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
    <verse number="52" style="v"/>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
    <verse number="53" style="v"/>For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.
    <verse number="54" style="v"/>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."
    <verse number="55" style="v"/>"O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?"
    <verse number="56" style="v"/>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
    <verse number="57" style="v"/>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <verse number="58" style="v"/>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.

    <verse number="1" style="v"/>Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
    <verse number="2" style="v"/>On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come.
    <verse number="3" style="v"/>And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
    <verse number="4" style="v"/>If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
    <verse number="5" style="v"/>I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia,
    <verse number="6" style="v"/>and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go.
    <verse number="7" style="v"/>For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
    <verse number="8" style="v"/>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
    <verse number="9" style="v"/>for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
    <verse number="10" style="v"/>When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am.
    <verse number="11" style="v"/>So let no one despise and the speaker a foreigner to me, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
    <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
    <verse number="13" style="v"/>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.
    <verse number="14" style="v"/>Let all that you do be done in love.
    <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now I urge you, brothers- you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints-
    <verse number="16" style="v"/>be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.
    <verse number="17" style="v"/>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence,
    <verse number="18" style="v"/>for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men.
    <verse number="19" style="v"/>The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord.
    <verse number="20" style="v"/>All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
    <verse number="21" style="v"/>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
    <verse number="22" style="v"/>If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!
    <verse number="23" style="v"/>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
    <verse number="24" style="v"/>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
