          <ab n="1">Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</ab>
          <ab n="2">but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</ab>
          <ab n="3">He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.</ab>
          <ab n="4">The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.</ab>
          <ab n="5">Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;</ab>
          <ab n="6">for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</ab>

          <ab n="1">Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</ab>
          <ab n="2">The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,</ab>
          <ab n="3">"Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us."</ab>
          <ab n="4">He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.</ab>
          <ab n="5">Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,</ab>
          <ab n="6">"As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."</ab>
          <ab n="7">I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.</ab>
          <ab n="8">Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.</ab>
          <ab n="9">You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</ab>
          <ab n="10">Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.</ab>
          <ab n="11">Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</ab>
          <ab n="12">Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</ab>

          <ab n="1">TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID, THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, WHO ADDRESSED THE WORDS OF THIS SONG TO THE LORD ON THE DAY WHEN THE LORD RESCUED HIM FROM THE HAND OF ALL HIS ENEMIES, AND FROM THE HAND OF SAUL. HE SAID: I love you, O LORD, my strength.</ab>
          <ab n="2">The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</ab>
          <ab n="3">I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</ab>
          <ab n="4">The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;</ab>
          <ab n="5">the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.</ab>
          <ab n="6">In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</ab>
          <ab n="7">Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</ab>
          <ab n="8">Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</ab>
          <ab n="9">He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</ab>
          <ab n="10">He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.</ab>
          <ab n="11">He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.</ab>
          <ab n="12">Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.</ab>
          <ab n="13">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</ab>
          <ab n="14">And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.</ab>
          <ab n="15">Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</ab>
          <ab n="16">He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.</ab>
          <ab n="17">He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</ab>
          <ab n="18">They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.</ab>
          <ab n="19">He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.</ab>
          <ab n="20">The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.</ab>
          <ab n="21">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</ab>
          <ab n="22">For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</ab>
          <ab n="23">I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.</ab>
          <ab n="24">So the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</ab>
          <ab n="25">With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;</ab>
          <ab n="26">with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.</ab>
          <ab n="27">For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.</ab>
          <ab n="28">For it is you who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.</ab>
          <ab n="29">For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.</ab>
          <ab n="30">This God- his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</ab>
          <ab n="31">For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?-</ab>
          <ab n="32">the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.</ab>
          <ab n="33">He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.</ab>
          <ab n="34">He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</ab>
          <ab n="35">You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.</ab>
          <ab n="36">You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</ab>
          <ab n="37">I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.</ab>
          <ab n="38">I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</ab>
          <ab n="39">For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.</ab>
          <ab n="40">You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</ab>
          <ab n="41">They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</ab>
          <ab n="42">I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</ab>
          <ab n="43">You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</ab>
          <ab n="44">As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</ab>
          <ab n="45">Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.</ab>
          <ab n="46">The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation-</ab>
          <ab n="47">the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,</ab>
          <ab n="48">who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.</ab>
          <ab n="49">For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.</ab>
          <ab n="50">Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.</ab>

          <ab n="11">Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</ab>
          <ab n="12">Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.</ab>

          <ab n="1">TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO THE DOE OF THE DAWN. A PSALM OF DAVID. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?</ab>
          <ab n="2">O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest.</ab>
          <ab n="3">Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.</ab>
          <ab n="4">In you our fathers trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.</ab>
          <ab n="5">To you they cried and were rescued; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</ab>
          <ab n="6">But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people.</ab>
          <ab n="7">All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;</ab>
          <ab n="8">"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"</ab>
          <ab n="9">Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.</ab>
          <ab n="10">On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb you have been my God.</ab>
          <ab n="11">Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help.</ab>
          <ab n="12">Many bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</ab>

          <ab n="14">In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.</ab>
          <ab n="15">He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.</ab>

          <ab n="28">he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.</ab>
          <ab n="29">And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.</ab>

          <ab n="31">the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.</ab>
          <ab n="32">In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe.</ab>
          <ab n="33">So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.</ab>
          <ab n="34">When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.</ab>
          <ab n="35">They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.</ab>

          <ab n="39">He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.</ab>
          <ab n="40">How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!</ab>
          <ab n="41">They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</ab>

          <ab n="44">He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.</ab>
          <ab n="45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</ab>
          <ab n="46">He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.</ab>
          <ab n="47">He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.</ab>
          <ab n="48">He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.</ab>
          <ab n="49">He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.</ab>
          <ab n="50">He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.</ab>
          <ab n="51">He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.</ab>
          <ab n="52">Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</ab>
          <ab n="53">He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</ab>
          <ab n="54">And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.</ab>
          <ab n="55">He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.</ab>
          <ab n="56">Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,</ab>
          <ab n="57">but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.</ab>
          <ab n="58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.</ab>
          <ab n="59">When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.</ab>
          <ab n="60">He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,</ab>
          <ab n="61">and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.</ab>
          <ab n="62">He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.</ab>
          <ab n="63">Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.</ab>
          <ab n="64">Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</ab>
          <ab n="65">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.</ab>
          <ab n="66">And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.</ab>
          <ab n="67">He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</ab>
          <ab n="68">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.</ab>
          <ab n="69">He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.</ab>
          <ab n="70">He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;</ab>
          <ab n="71">from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.</ab>
