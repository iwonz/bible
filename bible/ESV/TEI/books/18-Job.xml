      <div type="book" n="Job">
        <div type="chapter" n="1">
          <ab n="1">There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.</ab>
          <ab n="2">There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</ab>
          <ab n="3">He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.</ab>
          <ab n="4">His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</ab>
          <ab n="5">And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.</ab>
          <ab n="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.</ab>
          <ab n="7">The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</ab>
          <ab n="8">And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"</ab>
          <ab n="9">Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for no reason?</ab>
          <ab n="10">Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.</ab>
          <ab n="11">But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."</ab>
          <ab n="12">And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</ab>
          <ab n="13">Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</ab>
          <ab n="14">and there came a messenger to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,</ab>
          <ab n="15">and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</ab>
          <ab n="16">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</ab>
          <ab n="17">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</ab>
          <ab n="18">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</ab>
          <ab n="19">and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</ab>
          <ab n="20">Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.</ab>
          <ab n="21">And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."</ab>
          <ab n="22">In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="2">
          <ab n="1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.</ab>
          <ab n="2">And the LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</ab>
          <ab n="3">And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."</ab>
          <ab n="4">Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.</ab>
          <ab n="5">But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."</ab>
          <ab n="6">And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."</ab>
          <ab n="7">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.</ab>
          <ab n="8">And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.</ab>
          <ab n="9">Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."</ab>
          <ab n="10">But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</ab>
          <ab n="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.</ab>
          <ab n="12">And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.</ab>
          <ab n="13">And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3">
          <ab n="1">After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</ab>
          <ab n="2">And Job said:</ab>
          <ab n="3">"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'</ab>
          <ab n="4">Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.</ab>
          <ab n="5">Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</ab>
          <ab n="6">That night- let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</ab>
          <ab n="7">Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.</ab>
          <ab n="8">Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.</ab>
          <ab n="9">Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,</ab>
          <ab n="10">because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</ab>
          <ab n="11">"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?</ab>
          <ab n="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</ab>
          <ab n="13">For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</ab>
          <ab n="14">with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,</ab>
          <ab n="15">or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</ab>
          <ab n="16">Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?</ab>
          <ab n="17">There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</ab>
          <ab n="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</ab>
          <ab n="19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</ab>
          <ab n="20">"Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</ab>
          <ab n="21">who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</ab>
          <ab n="22">who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?</ab>
          <ab n="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</ab>
          <ab n="24">For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.</ab>
          <ab n="25">For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.</ab>
          <ab n="26">I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="4">
          <ab n="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking?</ab>
          <ab n="3">Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</ab>
          <ab n="4">Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.</ab>
          <ab n="5">But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</ab>
          <ab n="6">Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?</ab>
          <ab n="7">"Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?</ab>
          <ab n="8">As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</ab>
          <ab n="9">By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</ab>
          <ab n="10">The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken.</ab>
          <ab n="11">The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</ab>
          <ab n="12">"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it.</ab>
          <ab n="13">Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</ab>
          <ab n="14">dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</ab>
          <ab n="15">A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</ab>
          <ab n="16">It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:</ab>
          <ab n="17">'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?</ab>
          <ab n="18">Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;</ab>
          <ab n="19">how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.</ab>
          <ab n="20">Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.</ab>
          <ab n="21">Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="5">
          <ab n="1">"Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</ab>
          <ab n="2">Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.</ab>
          <ab n="3">I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.</ab>
          <ab n="4">His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.</ab>
          <ab n="5">The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</ab>
          <ab n="6">For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,</ab>
          <ab n="7">but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.</ab>
          <ab n="8">"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,</ab>
          <ab n="9">who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:</ab>
          <ab n="10">he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;</ab>
          <ab n="11">he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</ab>
          <ab n="12">He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</ab>
          <ab n="13">He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.</ab>
          <ab n="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.</ab>
          <ab n="15">But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.</ab>
          <ab n="16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.</ab>
          <ab n="17">"Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty.</ab>
          <ab n="18">For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.</ab>
          <ab n="19">He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.</ab>
          <ab n="20">In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</ab>
          <ab n="21">You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.</ab>
          <ab n="22">At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.</ab>
          <ab n="23">For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</ab>
          <ab n="24">You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.</ab>
          <ab n="25">You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth.</ab>
          <ab n="26">You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season.</ab>
          <ab n="27">Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."</ab>

        <div type="chapter" n="6">
          <ab n="1">Then Job answered and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</ab>
          <ab n="3">For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</ab>
          <ab n="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</ab>
          <ab n="5">Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?</ab>
          <ab n="6">Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?</ab>
          <ab n="7">My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.</ab>
          <ab n="8">"Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,</ab>
          <ab n="9">that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</ab>
          <ab n="10">This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</ab>
          <ab n="11">What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?</ab>
          <ab n="12">Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</ab>
          <ab n="13">Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?</ab>
          <ab n="14">"He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</ab>
          <ab n="15">My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,</ab>
          <ab n="16">which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.</ab>
          <ab n="17">When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</ab>
          <ab n="18">The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.</ab>
          <ab n="19">The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.</ab>
          <ab n="20">They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed.</ab>
          <ab n="21">For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.</ab>
          <ab n="22">Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?</ab>
          <ab n="23">Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?</ab>
          <ab n="24">"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.</ab>
          <ab n="25">How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?</ab>
          <ab n="26">Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?</ab>
          <ab n="27">You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.</ab>
          <ab n="28">"But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face.</ab>
          <ab n="29">Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.</ab>
          <ab n="30">Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?</ab>

        <div type="chapter" n="7">
          <ab n="1">"Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?</ab>
          <ab n="2">Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,</ab>
          <ab n="3">so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.</ab>
          <ab n="4">When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn.</ab>
          <ab n="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.</ab>
          <ab n="6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.</ab>

          <ab n="8">The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone.</ab>

          <ab n="12">Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?</ab>
          <ab n="13">When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'</ab>
          <ab n="14">then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</ab>
          <ab n="15">so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.</ab>
          <ab n="16">I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.</ab>
          <ab n="17">What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,</ab>
          <ab n="18">visit him every morning and test him every moment?</ab>
          <ab n="19">How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?</ab>
          <ab n="20">If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?</ab>

          <ab n="4">If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</ab>
          <ab n="5">If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,</ab>

          <ab n="1">Then Job answered and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!</ab>
          <ab n="3">How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</ab>
          <ab n="4">With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you?</ab>
          <ab n="5">The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants.</ab>
          <ab n="6">Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.</ab>
          <ab n="7">He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.</ab>
          <ab n="8">He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them.</ab>
          <ab n="9">He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud.</ab>
          <ab n="10">He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.</ab>
          <ab n="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.</ab>
          <ab n="12">By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.</ab>
          <ab n="13">By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</ab>
          <ab n="14">Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="27">
          <ab n="1">And Job again took up his discourse, and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,</ab>
          <ab n="3">as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,</ab>
          <ab n="4">my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.</ab>
          <ab n="5">Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.</ab>
          <ab n="6">I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.</ab>
          <ab n="7">"Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.</ab>
          <ab n="8">For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life?</ab>
          <ab n="9">Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?</ab>
          <ab n="10">Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</ab>
          <ab n="11">I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal.</ab>
          <ab n="12">Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?</ab>
          <ab n="13">"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:</ab>
          <ab n="14">If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread.</ab>
          <ab n="15">Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep.</ab>
          <ab n="16">Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay,</ab>
          <ab n="17">he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.</ab>
          <ab n="18">He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes.</ab>
          <ab n="19">He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone.</ab>
          <ab n="20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off.</ab>
          <ab n="21">The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</ab>
          <ab n="22">It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight.</ab>
          <ab n="23">It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place.</ab>

          <ab n="1">"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine.</ab>
          <ab n="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore.</ab>
          <ab n="3">Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.</ab>
          <ab n="4">He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro.</ab>
          <ab n="5">As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire.</ab>
          <ab n="6">Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.</ab>
          <ab n="7">"That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.</ab>
          <ab n="8">The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.</ab>
          <ab n="9">"Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots.</ab>
          <ab n="10">He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.</ab>
          <ab n="11">He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light.</ab>
          <ab n="12">"But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?</ab>
          <ab n="13">Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.</ab>
          <ab n="14">The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</ab>
          <ab n="15">It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price.</ab>
          <ab n="16">It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.</ab>
          <ab n="17">Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</ab>
          <ab n="18">No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above, pearls.</ab>
          <ab n="19">The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.</ab>
          <ab n="20">"From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?</ab>
          <ab n="21">It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.</ab>
          <ab n="22">Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'</ab>
          <ab n="23">"God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.</ab>
          <ab n="24">For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</ab>
          <ab n="25">When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,</ab>
          <ab n="26">when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,</ab>
          <ab n="27">then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.</ab>
          <ab n="28">And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"</ab>

          <ab n="1">And Job again took up his discourse, and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,</ab>
          <ab n="3">when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,</ab>
          <ab n="4">as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent,</ab>
          <ab n="5">when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me,</ab>
          <ab n="6">when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!</ab>
          <ab n="7">When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,</ab>
          <ab n="8">the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;</ab>
          <ab n="9">the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;</ab>
          <ab n="10">the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</ab>
          <ab n="11">When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,</ab>
          <ab n="12">because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him.</ab>
          <ab n="13">The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</ab>
          <ab n="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.</ab>
          <ab n="15">I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</ab>
          <ab n="16">I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.</ab>
          <ab n="17">I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth.</ab>
          <ab n="18">Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,</ab>
          <ab n="19">my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,</ab>
          <ab n="20">my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'</ab>
          <ab n="21">"Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.</ab>
          <ab n="22">After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them.</ab>
          <ab n="23">They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.</ab>
          <ab n="24">I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down.</ab>
          <ab n="25">I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.</ab>

          <ab n="3">Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation;</ab>

          <ab n="21">You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me.</ab>
          <ab n="22">You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm.</ab>

          <ab n="17">I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.</ab>
          <ab n="18">For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.</ab>

          <ab n="15">"Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox.</ab>
          <ab n="16">Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly.</ab>
          <ab n="17">He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.</ab>
          <ab n="18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron.</ab>
          <ab n="19">"He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword!</ab>
          <ab n="20">For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play.</ab>
          <ab n="21">Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh.</ab>
          <ab n="22">For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him.</ab>
          <ab n="23">Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth.</ab>
          <ab n="24">Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?</ab>

          <ab n="1">"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord?</ab>
          <ab n="2">Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</ab>
          <ab n="3">Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak to you soft words?</ab>
          <ab n="4">Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?</ab>

          <ab n="15">His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal.</ab>
          <ab n="16">One is so near to another that no air can come between them.</ab>

          <ab n="21">His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth.</ab>
          <ab n="22">In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.</ab>
          <ab n="23">The folds of his flesh stick together, firmly cast on him and immovable.</ab>
          <ab n="24">His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone.</ab>
          <ab n="25">When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.</ab>
          <ab n="26">Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.</ab>
          <ab n="27">He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.</ab>
          <ab n="28">The arrow cannot make him flee; for him sling stones are turned to stubble.</ab>
          <ab n="29">Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins.</ab>
          <ab n="30">His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire.</ab>
          <ab n="31">He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</ab>
          <ab n="32">Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired.</ab>
          <ab n="33">On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear.</ab>
          <ab n="34">He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride."</ab>

          <ab n="1">Then Job answered the LORD and said:</ab>
          <ab n="2">"I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</ab>
          <ab n="3">'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</ab>
          <ab n="4">'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you make it known to me.'</ab>
          <ab n="5">I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;</ab>
          <ab n="6">therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."</ab>
          <ab n="7">After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</ab>
          <ab n="8">Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</ab>
          <ab n="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</ab>
          <ab n="10">And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</ab>
          <ab n="11">Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold.</ab>
          <ab n="12">And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.</ab>
          <ab n="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</ab>
          <ab n="14">And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.</ab>
          <ab n="15">And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</ab>
          <ab n="16">And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</ab>
          <ab n="17">And Job died, an old man, and full of days.</ab>
