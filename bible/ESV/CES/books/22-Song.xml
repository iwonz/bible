          <seg type="verse" n="1">I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">I had put off my garment; how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="15">His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="9">My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?"</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="7">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights!</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="8">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</seg>
