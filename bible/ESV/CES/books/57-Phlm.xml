          <seg type="verse" n="1">Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you- I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother- especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it- to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</seg>
