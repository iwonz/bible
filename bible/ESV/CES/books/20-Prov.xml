          <seg type="verse" n="1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth-</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"-</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="27">when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="28">Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="29">Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="30">would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="31">therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="32">For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="33">but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</seg>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="2">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</seg>

        <div type="chapter" n="3">
          <seg type="verse" n="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">My son, do not lose sight of these- keep sound wisdom and discretion,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="27">Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"- when you have it with you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="29">Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="30">Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="31">Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="32">for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="34">Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="35">The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="1">Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="2">for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="3">When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="9">She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="24">Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="25">Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="3">For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="6">she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="7">And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="8">Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="11">and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="23">He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="3">then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="4">Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="5">save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="9">How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="12">A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="13">winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="14">with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="15">therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="19">a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="21">Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="22">When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</seg>

          <seg type="verse" n="25">Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="26">for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="27">Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="28">Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="30">People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="31">but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="32">He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</seg>
          <seg type="verse" n="33">Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</seg>
