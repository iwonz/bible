  <h1>Hebrews</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"? Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.1.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Now it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> It has been testified somewhere, "What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> putting everything in subjection under his feet." Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> saying, "I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Behold, I and the children God has given me."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.2.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses- as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> for forty years. Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, 'They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.3.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.3.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And again in this passage he said, "They shall not enter my rest."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> again he appoints a certain day, "Today," saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.4.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you";</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> as he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.5.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.5.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And this we will do if God permits.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> if they then fall away, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things- things that belong to salvation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.6.20"><sup><a href="#Heb.6.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.22"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.7.23"><sup><a href="#Heb.7.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,</p>

  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things.

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.8.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.8.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.3"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.6"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.7"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.8"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.9"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.10"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.11"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.12"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.13"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.14"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.15"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.16"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.17"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.18"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.19"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.20"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.21"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.22"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.23"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.24"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.25"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.26"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.27"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.9.28"><sup><a href="#Heb.9.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.1"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.2"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.4"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Heb.10.5"><sup><a href="#Heb.10.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me;</p>
