  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel- he is the God who is in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God that is in Jerusalem."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.1.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.8"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their kinsmen, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity.

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel."

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.3.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard far away.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.4.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses in Israel said to them, "You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us."</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.8.30"><sup><a href="#Ezra.8.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.8.32"><sup><a href="#Ezra.8.32" class="verse-number">32</a></sup> We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.8.34"><sup><a href="#Ezra.8.34" class="verse-number">34</a></sup> The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.8.35"><sup><a href="#Ezra.8.35" class="verse-number">35</a></sup> At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats.

  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> "And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.14"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations?

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.9.15"><sup><a href="#Ezra.9.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> O LORD the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.1"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.2"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: "We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.3"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.4"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.5"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.6"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, where he spent the night, neither eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.7"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.10"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have broken faith and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.11"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Now then make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.12"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, "It is so; we must do as you have said.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.13"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Ezra.10.14"><sup><a href="#Ezra.10.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> Let our officials stand for the whole assembly.
