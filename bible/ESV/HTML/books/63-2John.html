  <h1>2 John</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.1"><sup><a href="#2John.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.2"><sup><a href="#2John.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.3"><sup><a href="#2John.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.4"><sup><a href="#2John.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.5"><sup><a href="#2John.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And now I ask you, dear lady- not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning- that we love one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.6"><sup><a href="#2John.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.7"><sup><a href="#2John.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.8"><sup><a href="#2John.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.9"><sup><a href="#2John.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.10"><sup><a href="#2John.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.11"><sup><a href="#2John.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.12"><sup><a href="#2John.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="2John.1.13"><sup><a href="#2John.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The children of your elect sister greet you.</p>
