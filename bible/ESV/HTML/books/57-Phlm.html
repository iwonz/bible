  <h1>Philemon</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.1"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.2"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.3"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.4"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.5"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.6"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.7"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.8"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.9"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you- I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.10"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.11"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.12"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.13"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.14"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.15"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.16"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother- especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.17"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.18"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.19"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it- to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.20"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.21"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.22"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.23"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.24"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Phlm.1.25"><sup><a href="#Phlm.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
