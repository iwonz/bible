  <h1>Zechariah</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.1"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.2"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> "The LORD was very angry with your fathers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.3"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.4"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.' But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.5"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.6"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.7"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.8"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> "I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.9"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Then I said, 'What are these, my lord?' The angel who talked with me said to me, 'I will show you what they are.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.10"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, 'These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.'</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.12"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Then the angel of the LORD said, 'O LORD of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.13"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And the LORD answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.14"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> So the angel who talked with me said to me, 'Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.15"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little, they furthered the disaster.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.16"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Therefore, thus says the LORD, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; my house shall be built in it, declares the LORD of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.1.17"><sup><a href="#Zech.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Cry out again, Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.'"</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.2.1"><sup><a href="#Zech.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand!</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Zech.2.11"><sup><a href="#Zech.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.2.12"><sup><a href="#Zech.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem."</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.1"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.2"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.3"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.4"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And the angel said to those who were standing before him, "Remove the filthy garments from him."

  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.5"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.6"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured Joshua,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Zech.3.10"><sup><a href="#Zech.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Zech.4.1"><sup><a href="#Zech.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.</p>
