  <h1>Acts</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> To them he presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, "you heard from me;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> (Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "' May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it'; and "'Let another take his office.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us- one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.1.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.1.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And they were amazed and astonished, saying, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians- we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> But others mocking said, "They are filled with new wine."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> "'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know-</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> For David says concerning him, "' I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.27"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.28"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.29"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.29" class="verse-number">29</a></sup> "Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.30"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.31"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.31" class="verse-number">31</a></sup> he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.32"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.32" class="verse-number">32</a></sup> This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.33"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.33" class="verse-number">33</a></sup> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.34"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.34" class="verse-number">34</a></sup> For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, "' The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.35"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.35" class="verse-number">35</a></sup> until I make your enemies your footstool.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.36"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.36" class="verse-number">36</a></sup> Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.37"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.37" class="verse-number">37</a></sup> Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.38"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.38" class="verse-number">38</a></sup> And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.39"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.39" class="verse-number">39</a></sup> For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.40"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.40" class="verse-number">40</a></sup> And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.41"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.41" class="verse-number">41</a></sup> So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.42"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.42" class="verse-number">42</a></sup> And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.43"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.43" class="verse-number">43</a></sup> And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.44"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.44" class="verse-number">44</a></sup> And all who believed were together and had all things in common.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.45"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.45" class="verse-number">45</a></sup> And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.46"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.46" class="verse-number">46</a></sup> And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.2.47"><sup><a href="#Acts.2.47" class="verse-number">47</a></sup> praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> But Peter said, "I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: "Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> And his name- by faith in his name- has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> "And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.3.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.3.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."</p>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.4.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.4.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> "As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> And I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> "And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> And he said, 'The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> "When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> and saw him saying to me, 'Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> And I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.'</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.27"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> So the tribune came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.28"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> The tribune answered, "I bought this citizenship for a large sum." Paul said, "But I am a citizen by birth."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.29"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.29" class="verse-number">29</a></sup> So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.22.30"><sup><a href="#Acts.22.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Those who stood by said, "Would you revile God's high priest?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> And Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> The following night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of these things."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Then he called two of the centurions and said, "Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> And he wrote a letter to this effect:</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> "Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.27"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.28"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.28" class="verse-number">28</a></sup> And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.29"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.29" class="verse-number">29</a></sup> I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.30"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.30" class="verse-number">30</a></sup> And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.31"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.31" class="verse-number">31</a></sup> So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.32"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.32" class="verse-number">32</a></sup> And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.33"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.33" class="verse-number">33</a></sup> When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.34"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.34" class="verse-number">34</a></sup> On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.23.35"><sup><a href="#Acts.23.35" class="verse-number">35</a></sup> he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive." And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: "Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> ***</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.11"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.14"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.17"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.18"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia-</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.19"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.20"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.21"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.21" class="verse-number">21</a></sup> other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: 'It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.'"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.22"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.22" class="verse-number">22</a></sup> But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.23"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.24"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.24" class="verse-number">24</a></sup> After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.25"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.25" class="verse-number">25</a></sup> And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, "Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.26"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.26" class="verse-number">26</a></sup> At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.24.27"><sup><a href="#Acts.24.27" class="verse-number">27</a></sup> When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.1"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.2"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.3"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem- because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.4"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.5"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.5" class="verse-number">5</a></sup> "So," said he, "let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.6"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.7"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.8"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Paul argued in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.9"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?"</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.10"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourselves know very well.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.12"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, "To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go."</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.13"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.15"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Acts.25.16"><sup><a href="#Acts.25.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.</p>
