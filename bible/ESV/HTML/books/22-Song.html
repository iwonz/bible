  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.6"><sup><a href="#Song.1.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!</p>
  <p class="verse" id="Song.1.7"><sup><a href="#Song.1.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?</p>
