  <p class="verse" id="1John.2.23"><sup><a href="#1John.2.23" class="verse-number">23</a></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.1"><sup><a href="#1John.3.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.2"><sup><a href="#1John.3.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we will be like him, because we shall see him as he is.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.4"><sup><a href="#1John.3.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.8"><sup><a href="#1John.3.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.9"><sup><a href="#1John.3.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.10"><sup><a href="#1John.3.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.11"><sup><a href="#1John.3.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.12"><sup><a href="#1John.3.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.13"><sup><a href="#1John.3.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.14"><sup><a href="#1John.3.14" class="verse-number">14</a></sup> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.15"><sup><a href="#1John.3.15" class="verse-number">15</a></sup> Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.17"><sup><a href="#1John.3.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.3.18"><sup><a href="#1John.3.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.1"><sup><a href="#1John.4.1" class="verse-number">1</a></sup> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.2"><sup><a href="#1John.4.2" class="verse-number">2</a></sup> By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.3"><sup><a href="#1John.4.3" class="verse-number">3</a></sup> and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.4"><sup><a href="#1John.4.4" class="verse-number">4</a></sup> Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.6"><sup><a href="#1John.4.6" class="verse-number">6</a></sup> We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.7"><sup><a href="#1John.4.7" class="verse-number">7</a></sup> Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.8"><sup><a href="#1John.4.8" class="verse-number">8</a></sup> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.9"><sup><a href="#1John.4.9" class="verse-number">9</a></sup> In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.10"><sup><a href="#1John.4.10" class="verse-number">10</a></sup> In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.11"><sup><a href="#1John.4.11" class="verse-number">11</a></sup> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.12"><sup><a href="#1John.4.12" class="verse-number">12</a></sup> No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.13"><sup><a href="#1John.4.13" class="verse-number">13</a></sup> By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</p>

  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.16"><sup><a href="#1John.4.16" class="verse-number">16</a></sup> So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.17"><sup><a href="#1John.4.17" class="verse-number">17</a></sup> By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.18"><sup><a href="#1John.4.18" class="verse-number">18</a></sup> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.19"><sup><a href="#1John.4.19" class="verse-number">19</a></sup> We love because he first loved us.</p>
  <p class="verse" id="1John.4.20"><sup><a href="#1John.4.20" class="verse-number">20</a></sup> If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.</p>
