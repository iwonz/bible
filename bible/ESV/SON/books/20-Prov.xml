    <verse label="Prov 1:1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:2">To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth-</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:5">Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:6">to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:8">Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:9">for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:11">If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:12">like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:13">we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:14">throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"-</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:15">my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:17">For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:19">Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:20">Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:22">"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:23">If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:24">Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:25">because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:27">when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:28">Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:29">Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:30">would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:31">therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:32">For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 1:33">but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:2">making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:3">yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:4">if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:6">For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:7">he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:8">guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:10">for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:11">discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:12">delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:13">who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:14">who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:15">men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:16">So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:17">who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:18">for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:19">none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:20">So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 2:22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:2">for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:3">Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:4">So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:7">Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:8">It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:9">Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:10">then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:12">for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:13">Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:14">for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:15">She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:19">The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:20">by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:21">My son, do not lose sight of these- keep sound wisdom and discretion,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:22">and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:23">Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:24">If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:25">Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:27">Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"- when you have it with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:29">Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:30">Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:31">Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:32">for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:34">Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 3:35">The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:1">Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:2">for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:3">When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:4">he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:5">Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:6">Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:7">The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:8">Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:9">She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:10">Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:11">I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:12">When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:13">Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:14">Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:15">Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:16">For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:17">For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:18">But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:19">The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:20">My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:21">Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:22">For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:23">Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:24">Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:25">Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:26">Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 4:27">Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:1">My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:2">that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:3">For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:4">but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:5">Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:6">she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:7">And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:8">Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:9">lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:10">lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:11">and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:12">and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:13">I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:14">I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:15">Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:16">Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:17">Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:18">Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:19">a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:20">Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:21">For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:22">The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 5:23">He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:2">if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:3">then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:4">Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:5">save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:6">Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:7">Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:8">she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:9">How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:12">A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:13">winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:14">with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:15">therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:19">a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:21">Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:22">When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:23">For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:24">to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:25">Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:26">for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:27">Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:28">Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:30">People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:31">but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:32">He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:33">Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:34">For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 6:35">He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:1">My son, keep my wordsand treasure up my commandments with you;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:2">keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:3">bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:5">to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:6">For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:7">and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:8">passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:9">in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:10">And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:11">She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:12">now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:13">She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:14">"I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:15">so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:16">I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:18">Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:19">For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:20">he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home."</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:21">With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:22">All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:23">till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:24">And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:25">Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:26">for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 7:27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:1">Does not wisdom call?Does not understanding raise her voice?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:2">On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:3">beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:4">"To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:5">O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:6">Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:7">for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:8">All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:9">They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:10">Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:11">for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:12">"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:13">The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:14">I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:15">By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:16">by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:18">Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:19">My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:21">granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:22">"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:23">Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:24">When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:25">Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 8:26">before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.</verse>

    <verse label="Prov 30:23">an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:24">Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:25">the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:26">the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:27">the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:28">the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:29">Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:30">the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:31">the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:32">If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 30:33">For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:1">The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:2">What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows?</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:3">Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:5">lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:6">Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:7">let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:8">Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:9">Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:10">An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:11">The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:12">She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:13">She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:14">She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:15">She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:16">She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:17">She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:18">She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:19">She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:20">She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:21">She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:22">She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:23">Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:24">She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:25">Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:26">She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:27">She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:28">Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:29">"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all."</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:30">Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</verse>
    <verse label="Prov 31:31">Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.</verse>
