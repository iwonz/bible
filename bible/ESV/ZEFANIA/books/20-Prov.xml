    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, do not lose sight of these- keep sound wisdom and discretion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"- when you have it with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my wordsand treasure up my commandments with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Does not wisdom call?Does not understanding raise her voice?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,</VERS>
