      <VERS vnumber="1">I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">The fig tree ripens its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,</VERS>
