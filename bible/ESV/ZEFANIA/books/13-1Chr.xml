      <VERS vnumber="14">So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he relented from the calamity.

      <VERS vnumber="16">And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house. But do not let the plague be on your people."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD- give it to me at its full price- that the plague may be averted from the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Ornan said to David, "Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be careful now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the LORD; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and pure gold for the forks, the basins and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the LORD, all the work to be done according to the plan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David the king said to all the assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: "Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then David said to all the assembly, "Bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they offered sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the LORD made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
