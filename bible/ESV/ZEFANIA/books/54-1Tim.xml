  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="54" bname="1 Timothy">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but with what is proper for women who profess godliness- with good works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yet she will be saved through childbearing- if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Command and teach these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father. Treat younger men like brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Honor widows who are truly widows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has shown hospitality, has washed the feet of the saints, has cared for the afflicted, and has devoted herself to every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For some have already strayed after Satan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are really widows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain," and, "The laborer deserves his wages."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The sins of some men are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">which he will display at the proper time- he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for by professing it some have swerved from the faith. Grace be with you.</VERS>
