      <VERS vnumber="1">Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</VERS>
