    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">These are blemishes on your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, looking after themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They said to you, "In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And have mercy on those who doubt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.</VERS>
