    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, "The righteous shall live by faith."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you suppose, O man- you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself- that you will escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He will render to each one according to his works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For God shows no partiality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, "That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">By no means! For then how could God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And why not do evil that good may come?- as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as it is written: "None is righteous, no, not one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">no one understands; no one seeks for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive." "The venom of asps is under their lips."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Their feet are swift to shed blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">in their paths are ruin and misery,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and the way of peace they have not known."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"There is no fear of God before their eyes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">since God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring- not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"- in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, "So shall your offspring be."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">That is why his faith was "counted to him as righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For one will scarcely die for a righteous person- though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For one who has died has been set free from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Or do you not know, brothers- for I am speaking to those who know the law- that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and if children, then heirs- heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died- more than that, who was raised- who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As it is written, "For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I am speaking the truth in Christ- I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit-</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this is what the promise said: "About this time next year I will return and Sarah shall have a son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad- in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">she was told, "The older will serve the younger."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for dishonorable use?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">as it is written, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the righteousness based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'"(that is, to bring Christ down)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">or "'Who will descend into the abyss?'"(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for "Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob";</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And again it is said, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience- by word and deed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God- so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but as it is written, "Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church at Cenchreae,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she may need from you, for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.</VERS>
