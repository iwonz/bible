    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Jesse the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"' And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, "Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: "He shall be called a Nazarene."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered, "It is written, "' Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, "' He will command his angels concerning you,' and "'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, "' You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">"Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Pray then like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Give us this day our daily bread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he told them many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who has ears, let him hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: "' You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"Hear then the parable of the sower:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world, and the good seed is the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">"Have you understood all these things?" They said to him, "Yes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, "Bring them here to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he called the people to him and said to them, "Hear and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Peter said to him, "Explain the parable to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, "Are you also still without understanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the disciples said to him, "Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." So he left them and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Jesus, aware of this, said, "O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the tax?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What do I still lack?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">"For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">So the last will be first, and the first last."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, "' Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So too the second and third, down to the seventh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After them all, the woman died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the great and first commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">"'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">***</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man; seize him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came to do." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">and said, "Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."</VERS>
