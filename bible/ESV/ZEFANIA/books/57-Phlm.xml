    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you- I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother- especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it- to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</VERS>
