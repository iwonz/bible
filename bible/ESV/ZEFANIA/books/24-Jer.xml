    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the LORD."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see an almond branch."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, "I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest. All who ate of it incurred guilt; disaster came upon them, declares the LORD."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They did not say, 'Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the shepherds transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"Therefore I still contend with you, declares the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Be appalled, O heavens, at this; be shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The lions have roared against him; they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And now what do you gain by going to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Your evil will chastise you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"For long ago I broke your yoke and burst your bonds; but you said, 'I will not serve.' yes, on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down like a whore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">How can you say, 'I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done- a restless young camel running here and there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">a wild donkey used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is hopeless, for I have loved foreigners, and after them I will go.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' and to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, 'Arise and save us!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"Why do you contend with me? You have all transgressed against me, declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In vain have I struck your children; they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, 'We are free, we will come no more to you'?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">"How well you direct your course to seek love! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, 'I have not sinned.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">How much you go about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">From it too you will come away with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not that land be greatly polluted? You have played the whore with many lovers; and would you return to me? declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have the forehead of a whore; you refuse to be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have you not just now called to me, 'My father, you are the friend of my youth-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">will he be angry forever, will he be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah: "Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the whore?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I thought, 'After she has done all this she will return to me,' but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, "' Return, faithless Israel, declares the LORD. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, declares the LORD; I will not be angry forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Only acknowledge your guilt, that you rebelled against the LORD your God and scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree, and that you have not obeyed my voice, declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Return, O faithless children, declares the LORD; for I am your master; I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"'And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"'I said How I would set you among my sons, and give you a pleasant land, a heritage most beautiful of all nations. And I thought you would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband, so have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel, declares the LORD.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A voice on the bare heights is heard, the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"Return, O faithless sons; I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to you, for you are the LORD our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Truly the hills are a delusion, the orgies on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"If you return, O Israel, declares the LORD, to me you should return. If you remove your detestable things from my presence, and do not waver,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and if you swear, 'As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet through the land; cry aloud and say, 'Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, stay not, for I bring disaster from the north, and great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A lion has gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone out from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this put on sackcloth, lament, and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"In that day, declares the LORD, courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It shall be well with you,' whereas the sword has reached their very life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, he comes up like clouds; his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles- woe to us, for we are ruined!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil, that you may be saved. How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Warn the nations that he is coming; announce to Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Like keepers of a field are they against her all around, because she has rebelled against me, declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent, for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Crash follows hard on crash; the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"For my people are foolish; they know me not; they are stupid children; they have no understanding. They are 'wise'- in doing evil! But how to do good they know not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark; for I have spoken; I have purposed; I have not relented, nor will I turn back."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note! Search her squares to see if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth, that I may pardon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Though they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I said, "These are only the poor; they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I will go to the great and will speak to them, for they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God." But they all alike had broken the yoke; they had burst the bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down; a wolf from the desert shall devastate them. A leopard is watching their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of whores.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD; and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Go up through her vine rows and destroy, but make not a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the LORD's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous to me, declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have spoken falsely of the LORD and have said, 'He will do nothing; no disaster will come upon us, nor shall we see sword or famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The prophets will become wind; the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: "Because you have spoken this word, behold, I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall consume them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Behold, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, declares the LORD. It is an enduring nation; it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Their quiver is like an open tomb; they are all mighty warriors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; your fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"But even in those days, declares the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when your people say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but see not, who have ears, but hear not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do you not fear me? declares the LORD; Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They do not say in their hearts, 'Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have kept good from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For wicked men are found among my people; they lurk like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and rich;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">they have grown fat and sleek. They know no bounds in deeds of evil; they judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their direction; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Flee for safety, O people of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem, for disaster looms out of the north, and great destruction.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Arise, and let us attack by night and destroy her palaces!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For thus says the LORD of hosts: "Cut down her trees; cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her evil; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I turn from you in disgust, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus says the LORD of hosts: "They shall glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer pass your hand again over its branches."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, they cannot listen; behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. "Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men, also; both husband and wife shall be taken, the elderly and the very aged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown," says the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus says the LORD: "Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus says the LORD to me, "Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"You shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them- them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not listened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, "You shall die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "' Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus the LORD said to me: "Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give them this charge for their masters: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"'"But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortunetellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the LORD, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years." But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Go, tell Hananiah, 'Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the LORD.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders of the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, declares the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You will seek me and find me. When you seek me with all your heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, declares the LORD.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">'The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.'"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Thus says the LORD: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Alas! That day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is grievous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">"Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the officials said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, "Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jeremiah said, "You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, "' Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mud, they turn away from you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">because of the evil that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, 'Oh, do not do this abomination that I hate!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, the evil of the kings of Judah, the evil of their wives, your own evil, and the evil of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:</VERS>
