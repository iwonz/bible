      <VERS vnumber="1">The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now I ask you, dear lady- not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning- that we love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The children of your elect sister greet you.</VERS>
